#### # Introduction  
####   
#### After years of filling out forms and waiting, you've finally acquired your banking license.  
#### This means you are now officially eligible to open your own bank, hurray!  
####   
#### Your first priority is to get the IT systems up and running.  
#### After a day of hard work, you can already open and close accounts, as well as handle withdrawals and deposits.  
####   
#### Since you couldn't be bothered writing tests, you invite some friends to help test the system.  
#### However, after just five minutes, one of your friends claims they've lost money!  
#### While you're confident your code is bug-free, you start looking through the logs to investigate.  
####   
#### Ah yes, just as you suspected, your friend is at fault!  
#### They shared their test credentials with another friend, and together they conspired to make deposits and withdrawals from the same account _in parallel_.  
#### Who would do such a thing?  
####   
#### While you argue that it's physically _impossible_ for someone to access their account in parallel, your friend smugly notifies you that the banking rules _require_ you to support this.  
#### Thus, no parallel banking support, no go-live signal.  
#### Sighing, you create a mental note to work on this tomorrow.  
#### This will set your launch date back at _least_ one more day, but well...  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
####   
#### As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), your bank software must allow accounts to be safely accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.  
#### For example, there may be many deposits and withdrawals occurring in parallel; you need to ensure there are no [race conditions][wikipedia] between when you read the account balance and set the new balance.  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
####   
#### [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.cpp bank_account.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not use the keywords signed/unsigned char, short, int, long, or long long (and their unsigned forms) for variables, parameters, or return types.    
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types such as std::int8_t, std::uint16_t, std::int32_t, std::uint64_t, or project-specific typedefs/aliases that wrap them.    
#### - int is permitted only for the main() return type, its parameters (argc, argv), and as the dummy int in postfix ++/-- operators; avoid it elsewhere.    
#### - Typedef/using declarations that create aliases are allowed and encouraged for readability.    
#### - Plain char is covered by another rule; avoid it for integers.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Parenthesize every sub-expression that combines binary or ternary operators with different precedence levels ( *, /, %, +, -, <<, >>, <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, &, ^, |, &&, ||, ?: ).    
#### - Omit parentheses only when adjacent operators share the exact same precedence and associativity (e.g. `a + b - c`, `x & y ^ z`).    
#### - Unary operators may remain unparenthesized when used inside a larger expression (`a * -b` is OK).    
#### - Never rely on default precedence in conditions, assignments, returns, or initializers; make evaluation order explicit: `if ((a == 1) && (b > 0))`, `val = a * (b + 1);`.    
#### - Treat overloaded operators with the same caution; add parentheses for clarity even if the rule does not mandate it.    
#### - Example pitfalls: avoid `a * b + 1`, `if (a + b != c - d)`, `if (x == 0 && y > 1)`; rewrite with parentheses.  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Never convert character types (‘char’, ‘signed/unsigned char’, ‘wchar_t’, ‘char16_t’, ‘char32_t’) to or from any non-character arithmetic type (int, bool, enum, float, …); forbid both implicit assignments and casts.    
#### - Do not perform arithmetic, bitwise, relational (<, >, <=, >=), or ++/-- on character objects; only == and != between identical character types are allowed.    
#### - Initialise/assign character variables exclusively with character literals of the same category (e.g., char c = '\n'; wchar_t w = L'x';), not numeric constants.    
#### - When an integer representation is unavoidable, use library helpers such as std::char_traits<CharT>::to_int_type(), never rely on direct conversion.    
#### - Use <cctype>/<cwctype> utilities (std::isalpha, std::tolower, …) instead of numeric range checks on characters.    
#### - Raw byte or small-integer data should be held in std::byte, std::uint8_t, or int8_t, not in char-family types.    
#### - Unevaluated operands (sizeof, decltype, alignof) and casts to void of a function call returning a character are permissible.  
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep numeric assignments strictly safe: identical type category, signedness and size, or an allowed widening/constant case    
#### - OK: same category & signedness, destination wider, source is a single variable (id-expression) ‒ e.g. `uint32_t big = small8;`    
#### - OK: floating-point constant → wider floating type ‒ e.g. `long double ld = 1.0f;`    
#### - OK: integer constant/constant expression → any numeric type (or bit-field) whose range can hold the value ‒ e.g. `float f = 42;`, `uint8_t u = 255;`    
#### - Otherwise: do NOT assign, initialise, pass by value, return, or use in a `case` label    
####   • No wider→narrower size (e.g. `uint8_t u = uint32_t_val;`)    
####   • No signed↔unsigned change (e.g. `uint32_t = int32_t;`)    
####   • No integer↔floating conversion except the constant cases above    
####   • No value that exceeds target range    
#### - For widening, use a variable, not an arithmetic expression; if you must convert, use an explicit cast that yields a compliant source type first    
#### - Apply the same checks in constructors, default arguments, lambda captures, operator calls, etc. ‒ every by-value transfer counts as an assignment    
#### - Treat unscoped enums as their underlying integral type when checking these rules  
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always wrap the body of every `if` in `{ … }`, even if it is a single statement    
#### - Always wrap the body of every `else` in `{ … }`; braces may be omitted only when the `else` is immediately followed by another `if` (`else if`)    
#### - Do not place any non-braced statement directly after `if (…)` or `else`    
#### - Never write `if (condition);` — replace with a braced empty block or remove the statement    
#### - Keep braces and indentation consistent so the controlled block is visually unambiguous  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I'll implement a thread-safe bank account system that supports opening/closing accounts, deposits, and withdrawals. The implementation will use a mutex to ensure thread safety and follow the MISRA C++ rules specified.

## Changes needed:

1. **bank_account.h**: Define the BankAccount class with methods for open, close, deposit, withdraw, and balance operations
2. **bank_account.cpp**: Implement the thread-safe operations using std::mutex for synchronization

Here are the updated files:

bank_account.h
```
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <mutex>

namespace Bankaccount {

class Bankaccount {
public:
    Bankaccount();
    ~Bankaccount();
    
    // Open a new account with zero balance
    void open();
    
    // Close the account
    void close();
    
    // Deposit money into the account
    // Throws std::runtime_error if account is closed or amount is negative
    void deposit(std::int64_t amount);
    
    // Withdraw money from the account
    // Throws std::runtime_error if account is closed, amount is negative, or insufficient funds
    void withdraw(std::int64_t amount);
    
    // Get the current balance
    // Throws std::runtime_error if account is closed
    std::int64_t balance() const;

private:
    mutable std::mutex account_mutex;
    std::int64_t account_balance;
    bool is_open;
};

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
```

bank_account.cpp
```
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : account_balance(0), is_open(false) {
}

Bankaccount::~Bankaccount() {
}

void Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account already open");
    }
    is_open = true;
    account_balance = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account already closed");
    }
    is_open = false;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount < 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Cannot deposit negative amount");
    }
    account_balance = account_balance + amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount < 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Cannot withdraw negative amount");
    }
    if (amount > account_balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    account_balance = account_balance - amount;
}

std::int64_t Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    return account_balance;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
```

## Explanation of changes:

1. **Thread Safety**: Used `std::mutex` with `std::lock_guard` to ensure all operations are atomic and thread-safe. This prevents race conditions when multiple threads access the same account.

2. **Account State Management**: 
   - Added `is_open` flag to track account status
   - All operations check if the account is open before proceeding
   - Operations on closed accounts throw exceptions

3. **MISRA C++ Compliance**:
   - Used `std::int64_t` instead of primitive types like `int` or `long`
   - All `if` statements use compound statements (braces)
   - No character-to-numeric conversions
   - Appropriate numeric type assignments (using same type `std::int64_t` throughout)

4. **Error Handling**: All invalid operations throw `std::runtime_error` with descriptive messages:
   - Attempting operations on closed accounts
   - Negative deposits or withdrawals
   - Insufficient funds for withdrawals

5. **Const Correctness**: The `balance()` method is marked `const` and the mutex is marked `mutable` to allow locking in const methods.

The implementation ensures that parallel access to bank accounts is safe and operations maintain consistency even when accessed from multiple threads simultaneously.

Looking at the marked lines, I can see potential issues with the use of `std::int64_t` types. The error markers suggest there might be a problem with using these types directly. Based on the MISRA C++ rules provided earlier, particularly the rule about not using standard integer types directly, I should create type aliases for better readability and maintainability.

Let me fix this by adding appropriate type aliases:

bank_account.h
```
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <mutex>

namespace Bankaccount {

// Type aliases for better readability and MISRA compliance
using money_t = std::int64_t;

class Bankaccount {
public:
    Bankaccount();
    ~Bankaccount();
    
    // Open a new account with zero balance
    void open();
    
    // Close the account
    void close();
    
    // Deposit money into the account
    // Throws std::runtime_error if account is closed or amount is negative
    void deposit(money_t amount);
    
    // Withdraw money from the account
    // Throws std::runtime_error if account is closed, amount is negative, or insufficient funds
    void withdraw(money_t amount);
    
    // Get the current balance
    // Throws std::runtime_error if account is closed
    money_t balance() const;

private:
    mutable std::mutex account_mutex;
    money_t account_balance;
    bool is_open;
};

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
```

bank_account.cpp
```
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : account_balance(0), is_open(false) {
}

Bankaccount::~Bankaccount() {
}

void Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account already open");
    }
    is_open = true;
    account_balance = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account already closed");
    }
    is_open = false;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(money_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount < 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Cannot deposit negative amount");
    }
    account_balance = account_balance + amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(money_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount < 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Cannot withdraw negative amount");
    }
    if (amount > account_balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    account_balance = account_balance - amount;
}

money_t Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    return account_balance;
}

Looking at the error markers, it appears there might be an issue with the type alias or the use of `std::int64_t`. According to the MISRA C++ rules provided, we should use fixed-width types from `<cstdint>`, but the rule also encourages project-specific typedefs/aliases. Let me check if there's an issue with how we're using the type alias.

The issue might be that the type alias `money_t` is not being recognized properly in the return type and member variable declarations. Let me ensure the type alias is properly defined and used consistently:

bank_account.h
```
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <mutex>

namespace Bankaccount {

class Bankaccount {
public:
    // Type alias for money amounts
    using money_t = std::int64_t;
    
    Bankaccount();
    ~Bankaccount();
    
    // Open a new account with zero balance
    void open();
    
    // Close the account
    void close();
    
    // Deposit money into the account
    // Throws std::runtime_error if account is closed or amount is negative
    void deposit(money_t amount);
    
    // Withdraw money from the account
    // Throws std::runtime_error if account is closed, amount is negative, or insufficient funds
    void withdraw(money_t amount);
    
    // Get the current balance
    // Throws std::runtime_error if account is closed
    money_t balance() const;

private:
    mutable std::mutex account_mutex;
    money_t account_balance;
    bool is_open;
};

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
```

bank_account.cpp
```
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : account_balance(0), is_open(false) {
}

Bankaccount::~Bankaccount() {
}

void Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account already open");
    }
    is_open = true;
    account_balance = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account already closed");
    }
    is_open = false;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(Bankaccount::money_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount < 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Cannot deposit negative amount");
    }
    account_balance = account_balance + amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(Bankaccount::money_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount < 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Cannot withdraw negative amount");
    }
    if (amount > account_balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    account_balance = account_balance - amount;
}

Bankaccount::money_t Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    return account_balance;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
```

The changes I made:
1. Moved the `money_t` type alias inside the class as a public member type, which makes it clearer that it belongs to the `Bankaccount` class
2. Updated the implementation file to use the fully qualified type name `Bankaccount::money_t` for the function definitions

This should resolve any issues with the type alias not being recognized properly.

Looking at the error markers, it seems there might be an issue with using `std::int64_t` directly. According to the MISRA C++ rules, we should use fixed-width integer types, but perhaps the issue is that we need to be more explicit about the type usage. Let me try a different approach by using a typedef instead of a using declaration, and ensure we're following all MISRA rules strictly.

bank_account.h
```
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <mutex>

namespace Bankaccount {

class Bankaccount {
public:
    Bankaccount();
    ~Bankaccount();
    
    // Open a new account with zero balance
    void open();
    
    // Close the account
    void close();
    
    // Deposit money into the account
    // Throws std::runtime_error if account is closed or amount is negative
    void deposit(std::int32_t amount);
    
    // Withdraw money from the account
    // Throws std::runtime_error if account is closed, amount is negative, or insufficient funds
    void withdraw(std::int32_t amount);
    
    // Get the current balance
    // Throws std::runtime_error if account is closed
    std::int32_t balance() const;

private:
    mutable std::mutex account_mutex;
    std::int32_t account_balance;

I've made the following changes:
1. Removed the type alias that seemed to be causing issues
2. Changed from `std::int64_t` to `std::int32_t` for all money-related types (this should be sufficient for most banking operations and might resolve any type-related issues)
3. Used the fixed-width type directly as required by MISRA C++ rules
4. Kept all other thread-safety and error handling logic intact
