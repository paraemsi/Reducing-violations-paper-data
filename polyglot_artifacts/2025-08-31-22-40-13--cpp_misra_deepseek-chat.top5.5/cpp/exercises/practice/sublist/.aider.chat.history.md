#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given any two lists `A` and `B`, determine if:  
####   
#### - List `A` is equal to list `B`; or  
#### - List `A` contains list `B` (`A` is a superlist of `B`); or  
#### - List `A` is contained by list `B` (`A` is a sublist of `B`); or  
#### - None of the above is true, thus lists `A` and `B` are unequal  
####   
#### Specifically, list `A` is equal to list `B` if both lists have the same values in the same order.  
#### List `A` is a superlist of `B` if `A` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `B`.  
#### List `A` is a sublist of `B` if `B` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `A`.  
####   
#### Examples:  
####   
#### - If `A = []` and `B = []` (both lists are empty), then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = []`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = []` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4, 5]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `B = [2, 3, 4]`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 3, 2]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: sublist.h sublist.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement functionality to compare two lists and determine their relationship: equal, superlist, sublist, or unequal. Let's think through this carefully.

Since we're dealing with lists, we can use vectors to represent them. The key is to check if one list is a sublist of another, which means finding a contiguous subsequence that matches exactly.

However, since the lists can be of any type, we'll use templates to make it generic. But the instructions don't specify the type, so we need to be careful.

Wait, the function signature isn't provided, so we need to define it. Let's define a function that takes two vectors and returns an enum indicating the relationship.

Let's start by defining the enum in the header file.

Here's the plan:
1. Add an enum class to represent the possible relationships
2. Implement a function to check if one list is a sublist of another
3. Compare the lists to determine their relationship

Here are the necessary changes:

sublist.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#pragma once

namespace sublist {

}  // namespace sublist
=======
#pragma once
#include <vector>

namespace sublist {

enum class ListComparison {
    equal,
    sublist,
    superlist,
    unequal
};

template <typename T>
ListComparison compare(const std::vector<T>& list1, const std::vector<T>& list2);

}  // namespace sublist
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation in sublist.cpp, we need to implement the compare function. Since it's a template function, we need to either put the implementation in the header or explicitly instantiate it. But the instructions say to modify sublist.cpp, so we'll put the implementation there.

Wait, templates need to be in headers, or we need to explicitly instantiate them. Since we don't know what types will be used, we need to put the implementation in the header. But the instructions say to modify both files, so perhaps we need to include the implementation in the header.

Actually, the implementation needs to be visible where it's used, so it should be in the header. Let's move the implementation to the header.

Wait, the user wants to modify sublist.cpp, so maybe they want the implementation there. But that won't work for templates. Let's think.

Since the tests may be using specific types, we can implement non-template versions, but the instructions don't specify. Let's assume we need to handle any type, so we need templates.

Wait, the examples show integers, but the implementation should be generic. Let's put the implementation in the header.

Wait, the user wants to modify sublist.cpp, so perhaps they want helper functions there. Let's implement a helper function to check if one list is a sublist of another.

Actually, let's implement a function to check if list B is found in list A starting at index i
But to follow the rules, we need to be careful with types.

Here's the implementation:

sublist.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#pragma once
#include <vector>

namespace sublist {

enum class ListComparison {
    equal,
    sublist,
    superlist,
    unequal
};

template <typename T>
ListComparison compare(const std::vector<T>& list1, const std::vector<T>& list2);

}  // namespace sublist
=======
#pragma once
#include <vector>

namespace sublist {

enum class ListComparison {
    equal,
    sublist,
    superlist,
    unequal
};

template <typename T>
ListComparison compare(const std::vector<T>& list1, const std::vector<T>& list2) {
    // Check if list1 is equal to list2
    if (list1 == list2) {
        return ListComparison::equal;
    }
    
    // Check if list1 is a superlist of list2 (list1 contains list2)
    if (list1.size() > list2.size()) {
        for (size_t i = 0; i <= (list1.size() - list2.size()); i++) {
            bool found = true;
            for (size_t j = 0; j < list2.size(); j++) {
                if (list1[i + j] != list2[j]) {
                    found = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (found) {
                return ListComparison::superlist;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Check if list1 is a sublist of list2 (list2 contains list1)
    if (list1.size() < list2.size()) {
        for (size_t i = 0; i <= (list2.size() - list1.size()); i++) {
            bool found = true;
            for (size_t j = 0; j < list1.size(); j++) {
                if (list2[i + j] != list1[j]) {
                    found = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (found) {
                return ListComparison::sublist;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return ListComparison::unequal;
}

}  // namespace sublist
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, this implementation needs to handle cases where sizes could cause underflow. For example, when list1.size() < list2.size(), list1.size() - list2.size() would underflow if we use unsigned integers. But we're using size_t which is unsigned, so it's fine because we're checking sizes first.

Wait, the implementation needs to follow the rules:
1. Always use braces for if/else
2. Parenthesize expressions properly
3. No numerical values of characters (but we're comparing using != which is allowed for the same types)

This implementation should work. Let's test the cases:
- Empty lists: both equal
- A superlist of B when B is empty: list1.size() > list2.size() is true, and we'll find an empty list at every index
- A sublist of B when A is empty: similar to above

This seems correct.

Since the implementation is templated, it needs to be in the header. So we can remove the content from sublist.cpp or leave it empty.

Wait, the user wants to modify sublist.cpp, so let's leave it empty:

sublist.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "sublist.h"

namespace sublist {

}  // namespace sublist
=======
#include "sublist.h"

namespace sublist {

}  // namespace sublist
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should work for all the provided examples. Let's hope it meets the requirements.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to follow the MISRA C++ rules. Let's fix the issues:

1. We need to include <cstdint> and use fixed-width integer types
2. Add proper parentheses to expressions
3. Ensure all if statements have braces
4. Handle potential underflow when subtracting sizes

Wait, since sizes can't be negative (they're always >= 0), and we're comparing them first, it's fine.
But to follow the rules, we need to use std::int32_t or similar for indices.

However, size() returns size_t which is implementation-defined. To follow the rules, we need to cast to a fixed-width type.
But according to the rules, we should avoid using standard integer types directly.

Let's use std::int64_t for indices to handle large sizes.

Here are the necessary fixes:

```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to cast indices when accessing vector elements because vectors use size_t for indexing
2. We're using std::int64_t for loop variables to follow the rules
3. All casts are explicit to avoid any implicit conversions
4. The comparisons are done using the same types to follow the rules

This implementation should now follow the MISRA C++ rules while maintaining the same functionality. Let's test the cases:
- When sizes are equal, it first checks for equality using == which is valid
- When one list is larger, it checks if the other is a sublist
- All loops use proper types and casts

This should work. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to handle cases where the lists could be empty, and we need to ensure all operations are valid. Let's fix this by adding proper checks for empty lists and ensuring we don't access out of bounds.

However, the main issue seems to be that when one of the lists is empty, we need to handle it correctly:
- An empty list is a sublist of any list
- Any list is a superlist of an empty list
- Two empty lists are equal

Let's fix the implementation:

sublist.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
template <typename T>
ListComparison compare(const std::vector<T>& list1, const std::vector<T>& list2) {
    // Check if list1 is equal to list2
    if (list1 == list2) {
        return ListComparison::equal;
    }
    
    // Check if list1 is a superlist of list2 (list1 contains list2)
    if (list1.size() > list2.size()) {
        for (std::int64_t i = 0; i <= (static_cast<std::int64_t>(list1.size()) - static_cast<std::int64_t>(list2.size())); i++) {
            bool found = true;
            for (std::int64_t j = 0; j < static_cast<std::int64_t>(list2.size()); j++) {
                if (list1[static_cast<std::size_t>(i + j)] != list2[static_cast<std::size_t>(j)]) {
                    found = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (found) {
                return ListComparison::superlist;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Check if list1 is a sublist of list2 (list2 contains list1)
    if (list1.size() < list2.size()) {
        for (std::int64_t i = 0; i <= (static_cast<std::int64_t>(list2.size()) - static_cast<std::int64_t>(list1.size())); i++) {
            bool found = true;
            for (std::int64_t j = 0; j < static_cast<std::int64_t>(list1.size()); j++) {
                if (list2[static_cast<std::size_t>(i + j)] != list1[static_cast<std::size_t>(j)]) {
                    found = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (found) {
                return ListComparison::sublist;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return ListComparison::unequal;
}

```

This implementation now properly handles empty lists:
1. If both are empty, they're equal
2. If list1 is empty and list2 is not, list1 is a sublist of list2
3. If list2 is empty and list1 is not, list1 is a superlist of list2

This should now pass all the test cases mentioned in the instructions:
- A = [] and B = [] -> equal
- A = [1, 2, 3] and B = [] -> superlist
- A = [] and B = [1, 2, 3] -> sublist

Let's also make sure all if statements have braces, which they do, and that we're using proper parentheses in expressions.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle cases where the lists are of the same size but not equal, which should return `unequal`. The current implementation may not be handling that correctly because it only checks for superlist and sublist when the sizes are different.

Wait, the implementation first checks if they're equal using `==`, which is correct. So if they're the same size but not equal, it will skip all other conditions and return `unequal`.

However, there's another issue: when the lists are of the same size, we need to ensure they're either equal or unequal, and not consider superlist/sublist relationships.

Let's test this implementation with:
A = [1, 2, 3], B = [1, 3, 2] -> should be unequal
Since they're the same size, the implementation will:
1. Check if both are empty: no
2. Check if either is empty: no
3. Check if they're equal using ==: no
4. Check if list1.size() > list2.size(): no
5. Check if list1.size() < list2.size(): no
6. Return unequal: correct

This seems to work. So perhaps the implementation is correct.

Wait, the user may be seeing errors from a test suite that we can't see. Let's make sure all conditions are properly handled.

Actually, there's one more case: when the lists are of the same size but not equal, we need to make sure we don't try to find them as sublists or superlists, which we don't.

This implementation seems correct. Perhaps the issue is with the handling of empty lists when one is empty and the other is not.

Wait, the instructions say:
- If A = [] and B = [1, 2, 3], then A is a sublist of B
- If A = [1, 2, 3] and B = [], then A is a superlist of B

This matches our implementation:
1. list1.empty() is true, list2.empty() is false -> return sublist
2. list2.empty() is true -> return superlist

This seems correct.

Perhaps the issue is with integer types or other MISRA violations. Let's ensure all expressions are properly parenthesized:

Wait, the rules say to always parenthesize binary expressions when they're operands of other operators with different precedence.
Let's add parentheses where needed:

Here are the necessary fixes:

```

This adds parentheses around:
1. The subtraction in max_start calculation
2. The index calculation (i + j)
3. The comparison in the if condition

This should now follow the MISRA rules about parenthesizing expressions. Let's hope this fixes any issues.

I understand. The tests are expecting a function called `sublist` that takes two vectors and returns a `List_comparison` enum, not a `compare` function. Let's fix this.

Here are the necessary changes:

sublist.h

    // Handle empty lists first
    if (list1.empty() && list2.empty()) {
        return ListComparison::equal;
    } else if (list1.empty()) {
        // An empty list is a sublist of any non-empty list
        return ListComparison::sublist;
    } else if (list2.empty()) {
        // Any non-empty list is a superlist of an empty list
        return ListComparison::superlist;
    }
    
    // Check if list1 is equal to list2
    if (list1 == list2) {
        return ListComparison::equal;
    }
    
    // Check if list1 is a superlist of list2 (list1 contains list2)
    if (list1.size() > list2.size()) {
        std::int64_t max_start = (static_cast<std::int64_t>(list1.size()) - static_cast<std::int64_t>(list2.size()));
        for (std::int64_t i = 0; i <= max_start; i++) {
            bool found = true;

```

This change renames:
1. `ListComparison` to `List_comparison` (to match the test expectations)
2. `compare` to `sublist` (to match the test expectations)

The implementation remains the same, just with different names to match what the tests are looking for. This should now compile and pass the tests.

The implementation looks correct, but the tests may be expecting a non-templated function that works with integers. Let's add an explicit instantiation for integers in the .cpp file to ensure the symbol is available for linking.

Here are the necessary changes:

sublist.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "sublist.h"

namespace sublist {

}  // namespace sublist
=======
#include "sublist.h"

namespace sublist {

// Explicit instantiation for integers
template List_comparison sublist(const std::vector<int>& list1, const std::vector<int>& list2);

}  // namespace sublist
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This should resolve any linking issues by providing an explicit instantiation of the template function for integers, which is likely what the tests are using.
