#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Clean up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.  
####   
#### The **North American Numbering Plan (NANP)** is a telephone numbering system used by many countries in North America like the United States, Canada or Bermuda.  
#### All NANP-countries share the same international country code: `1`.  
####   
#### NANP numbers are ten-digit numbers consisting of a three-digit Numbering Plan Area code, commonly known as _area code_, followed by a seven-digit local number.  
#### The first three digits of the local number represent the _exchange code_, followed by the unique four-digit number which is the _subscriber number_.  
####   
#### The format is usually represented as  
####   
#### ```text  
#### NXX NXX-XXXX  
#### ```  
####   
#### where `N` is any digit from 2 through 9 and `X` is any digit from 0 through 9.  
####   
#### Sometimes they also have the country code (represented as `1` or `+1`) prefixed.  
####   
#### Your task is to clean up differently formatted telephone numbers by removing punctuation and the country code if present.  
####   
#### For example, the inputs  
####   
#### - `+1 (613)-995-0253`  
#### - `613-995-0253`  
#### - `1 613 995 0253`  
#### - `613.995.0253`  
####   
#### should all produce the output  
####   
#### `6139950253`  
####   
#### **Note:** As this exercise only deals with telephone numbers used in NANP-countries, only 1 is considered a valid country code.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: phone_number.cpp phone_number.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I understand. We need to implement a function that cleans up phone numbers according to the NANP rules. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the function isn't specified, I'll assume we need to implement a class or function that can parse and validate phone numbers. Let's create a `phone_number` class that takes a raw number string and provides a cleaned number.

However, the instructions mention that the cleaned number should be a 10-digit number without any punctuation or country code. Also, we need to validate that the number follows NANP rules:
1. Area code (first 3 digits) must start with 2-9
2. Exchange code (next 3 digits) must start with 2-9
3. Subscriber number (last 4 digits) can be any digits

Since the country code can be present, it must be '1' and we need to remove it to get the 10-digit number.

Let's implement this:

Wait, the function signature isn't specified, so we need to decide what to implement. Since it's C++, let's make a class that can parse and provide the number.

However, the instructions might expect a specific interface. Let's implement a constructor that takes a raw number and validates it, and provide a number() method to get the cleaned number.

Here's the plan:
1. Remove all non-digit characters
2. Check if the number has 10 digits: it's valid
3. Check if the number has 11 digits and the first digit is '1': remove the '1' and use the remaining 10 digits
4. Otherwise, it's invalid
5. Validate that area code and exchange code start with digits 2-9

Let's implement:

Wait, the instructions say to clean up the number, but also to ensure it's valid according to NANP rules.
If it's invalid, we should probably throw an exception.

Here are the implementations:

phone_number.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PHONE_NUMBER_H)
#define PHONE_NUMBER_H

namespace phone_number {

}  // namespace phone_number

#endif // PHONE_NUMBER_H
=======
#if !defined(PHONE_NUMBER_H)
#define PHONE_NUMBER_H

#include <string>

namespace phone_number {

class phone_number {
public:
    explicit phone_number(const std::string& raw_number);
    std::string number() const;
    std::string area_code() const;
    operator std::string() const;
    
private:
    std::string cleaned_number;
};

}  // namespace phone_number

#endif // PHONE_NUMBER_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in phone_number.cpp:

phone_number.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "phone_number.h"

namespace phone_number {

}  // namespace phone_number
=======
#include "phone_number.h"
#include <string>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cctype>
#include <algorithm>

namespace phone_number {

phone_number::phone_number(const std::string& raw_number) {
    // Extract only digits
    for (char c : raw_number) {
        if (std::isdigit(c)) {
            cleaned_number += c;
        }
    }
    
    // Validate the number of digits
    if (cleaned_number.length() == 11) {
        if (cleaned_number[0] == '1') {
            cleaned_number = cleaned_number.substr(1);
        } else {
            throw std::domain_error("Invalid if 11 digits does not start with 1");
        }
    } else if (cleaned_number.length() != 10) {
        throw std::domain_error("Invalid number of digits");
    }
    
    // Validate area code (first digit must be 2-9)
    if (cleaned_number[0] < '2' || cleaned_number[0] > '9') {
        throw std::domain_error("Area code must start with digit 2-9");
    }
    
    // Validate exchange code (fourth digit must be 2-9)
    if (cleaned_number[3] < '2' || cleaned_number[3] > '9') {
        throw std::domain_error("Exchange code must start with digit 2-9");
    }
}

std::string phone_number::number() const {
    return cleaned_number;
}

std::string phone_number::area_code() const {
    return cleaned_number.substr(0, 3);
}

phone_number::operator std::string() const {
    // Format as NXX NXX-XXXX
    return "(" + cleaned_number.substr(0, 3) + ") " + 
           cleaned_number.substr(3, 3) + "-" + 
           cleaned_number.substr(6);
}

}  // namespace phone_number
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, the instructions don't mention anything about formatting the number, just cleaning it up to get the 10-digit number. So the number() method should just return the 10-digit string. The operator std::string() might not be necessary, but it's included to be thorough.

Wait, the instructions say:
"Clean up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages."
This suggests we just need to provide the cleaned number, which is what number() does.

However, the example shows that all inputs should produce '6139950253', which matches our implementation.

This implementation should handle:
1. Removing all non-digit characters
2. Validating and removing the country code if present and valid
3. Ensuring the number is exactly 10 digits
4. Validating area code and exchange code start with digits 2-9
5. Throwing exceptions for invalid numbers

This seems to meet all the requirements. Let's proceed with this implementation.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to match the expected interface. Let's analyze:

1. The class name should be `phone_number` (which matches)
2. The public interface needs to have:
   - A constructor taking a raw number string
   - `number()` method that returns the cleaned number
   - `area_code()` method that returns the area code
   - Conversion operator to std::string

However, the implementation needs to be correct:
1. Remove all non-digit characters
2. Check if the number has 11 digits and starts with '1' - if yes, remove the '1'
3. The resulting number must be exactly 10 digits
4. Validate area code and exchange code start with digits 2-9
5. Throw domain_error for invalid numbers

Let's fix the implementation:

Here are the necessary fixes:

phone_number.cpp
```cpp

    for (char c : raw_number) {
        if (std::isdigit(c)) {
            cleaned_number += c;
        }
    }
    
    // Validate the number of digits
    if (cleaned_number.length() == 11) {
        if (cleaned_number[0] == '1') {
            cleaned_number = cleaned_number.substr(1);
        } else {
            throw std::domain_error("Invalid if 11 digits does not start with 1");
        }
    } else if (cleaned_number.length() != 10) {
        throw std::domain_error("Invalid number of digits");
    }
    
    // Validate area code (first digit must be 2-9)
    if (cleaned_number[0] < '2' || cleaned_number[0] > '9') {
        throw std::domain_error("Area code must start with digit 2-9");
    }

    if (cleaned_number[3] < '2' || cleaned_number[3] > '9') {
        throw std::domain_error("Exchange code must start with digit 2-9");
    }
}

std::string phone_number::number() const {
    return cleaned_number;
}

std::string phone_number::area_code() const {
    return cleaned_number.substr(0, 3);
}

phone_number::operator std::string() const {
    // Format as NXX NXX-XXXX
    return "(" + cleaned_number.substr(0, 3) + ") " + 
           cleaned_number.substr(3, 3) + "-" + 
           cleaned_number.substr(6);
}

}  // namespace phone_number

#include "phone_number.h"
#include <string>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cctype>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

namespace phone_number {

phone_number::phone_number(const std::string& raw_number) {
    // First, extract all digits
    std::string digits;
    for (char c : raw_number) {
        if (std::isdigit(c)) {
            digits += c;
        }
    }
    
    // Check length and country code
    if (digits.length() == 11) {
        if (digits[0] == '1') {
            digits = digits.substr(1);
        } else {
            throw std::domain_error("invalid number");
        }
    }
    
    // Check if now we have exactly 10 digits
    if (digits.length() != 10) {
        throw std::domain_error("invalid number");
    }
    
    // Check area code (first digit)
    if (digits[0] < '2' || digits[0] > '9') {
        throw std::domain_error("invalid area code");
    }
    
    // Check exchange code (fourth digit)
    if (digits[3] < '2' || digits[3] > '9') {
        throw std::domain_error("invalid exchange code");
    }
    
    cleaned_number = digits;
}

std::string phone_number::number() const {
    return cleaned_number;
}

std::string phone_number::area_code() const {
    return cleaned_number.substr(0, 3);
}

phone_number::operator std::string() const {
    return "(" + area_code() + ") " + cleaned_number.substr(3, 3) + "-" + cleaned_number.substr(6);
}

}  // namespace phone_number
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, the error messages need to be consistent. The tests might expect specific error messages, but since we don't know, we'll use generic ones. If the tests fail due to specific error messages, we can adjust them later.

This implementation should now:
1. Properly clean the number by removing non-digit characters
2. Handle the country code correctly
3. Validate the number of digits
4. Validate area code and exchange code
5. Provide the required interface

Let's hope this works! If there are issues with specific error messages, we may need to adjust them to match what the tests expect.
