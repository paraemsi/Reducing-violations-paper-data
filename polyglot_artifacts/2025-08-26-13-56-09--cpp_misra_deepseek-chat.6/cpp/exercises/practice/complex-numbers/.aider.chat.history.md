#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.  
####   
#### `a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.  
#### The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.  
#### The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.  
####   
#### The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:  
#### `(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,  
#### `(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.  
####   
#### Multiplication result is by definition  
#### `(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.  
####   
#### The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is  
#### `1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:  
#### `(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Raising e to a complex exponent can be expressed as `e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`, the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,  
#### - conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.  
####   
#### Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: complex_numbers.h complex_numbers.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I'll implement a complex number class with the required operations. Let's start by defining the Complex class in the header file and implementing its methods in the source file.

First, we need to include the necessary headers and define the class structure. Since we're dealing with floating point numbers, we'll use double precision floating point types.

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement all these methods in the source file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "complex_numbers.h"

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
#include "complex_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

Complex::Complex(double real, double imag) : real_(real), imag_(imag) {}

double Complex::real() const {
    return real_;
}

double Complex::imag() const {
    return imag_;
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}

Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_, -imag_);
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex(magnitude * std::cos(imag_), magnitude * std::sin(imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_ + other.real_, imag_ + other.imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_ - other.real_, imag_ - other.imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    // (a + bi)*(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (real_ * other.imag_) + (imag_ * other.real_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    // (a + bi)/(c + di) = [(ac + bd)/(c^2 + d^2)] + [(bc - ad)/(c^2 + d^2)]i
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all operations follow the MISRA C++ rules. Let's check:

1. We're using double for all floating point operations, which is consistent
2. All operations are appropriately parenthesized
3. No integer types are being used where floating point types should be used
4. All binary operations are properly parenthesized to indicate precedence

Wait, the implementation looks good:
- All arithmetic operations are properly parenthesized
- We're using the correct types consistently
- No narrowing conversions
- All operations are implemented according to the mathematical definitions

This implementation should work for:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Conjugate, absolute value, and exponent
- All using proper floating point arithmetic

Note: The exponent function implements e^z where z is the complex number, which matches the instruction to implement "exponent of a given complex number".

I understand. The implementation needs to match the interface. The provided implementation seems correct, but let's make sure all the function signatures match. Since the implementation is already provided and matches the header, there might be another issue.

Wait, the instructions say "Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc." This suggests that the tests may be expecting certain function names that aren't matching.

However, the provided implementation seems to implement a Complex class with member functions, which matches the header. But perhaps the tests expect free functions instead of member functions? Or perhaps there's a different interface expected.

Wait, the original header might have had a different interface. Let's think about what the tests might expect. Since the instructions say not to change existing function names, and the implementation uses a class, this seems correct.

But perhaps the tests are expecting to use the class in a certain way. Let's make sure all operations are implemented correctly.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Let's run through each operation:
1. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division: all implemented as operators
2. Conjugate, absolute value, exponent: implemented as member functions

This matches the requirements.

However, the implementation of `exp()` might be incorrect. The instructions say to implement "exponent of a given complex number", which could mean raising e to the power of the complex number, which is what's implemented. But perhaps it's supposed to be a different operation.

Wait, the implementation of `exp()` is correct according to the mathematical definition provided:
e^(a + i*b) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))

But perhaps the tests expect a different signature. Let's see if there are any issues with the implementation.

Actually, everything seems correct. Maybe the issue is that the tests are not using the class-based approach, but that seems unlikely since the header defines a class.

Perhaps there are missing operators or functions. Let's make sure we've implemented everything needed.

Wait, the implementation looks complete. Let's check if there are any compilation issues:
1. All member functions are implemented
2. All operators are implemented
3. All types match

Since the implementation matches the header, and the header seems correct, perhaps there are no errors.

However, the user says to "fix any errors below", but no specific errors are shown. Maybe there are some issues with the implementation that aren't visible.

Let's make sure all operations follow the mathematical definitions precisely:
1. Addition: correct
2. Subtraction: correct
3. Multiplication: correct
4. Division: correct
5. Conjugate: correct
6. Absolute value: correct
7. Exponent: correct

Perhaps there's an issue with the implementation of division by zero? But the instructions don't specify handling that case.

Since we can't see the actual errors, we need to be careful. Let's make sure all operations are properly parenthesized according to MISRA rules.

Wait, in the implementation, all expressions seem to be properly parenthesized:
1. `abs()`: (real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_) - good
2. Multiplication: (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_) - good
3. Division: all sub-expressions are properly parenthesized

Wait, in the division implementation, there's:
`double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);`
This is correct.

Perhaps the issue is that the tests expect the functions to be in a certain order or have certain names that don't match.

Since we can't see the actual errors, and the implementation seems correct, I'll assume it's fine.

However, to be thorough, let's make sure all function signatures match exactly between the header and implementation:
1. Constructor: matches
2. real(), imag(): matches
3. abs(), conj(), exp(): matches
4. All operators: matches

Everything seems to match. Perhaps there are no errors to fix.

Since the user asked to fix any errors, but none are visible, I'll provide the implementation as-is. If there are specific errors, they need to be provided.

#### Fix the code in complex_numbers.h complex_numbers.cpp to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests are trying to perform operations between Complex numbers and doubles, but our implementation only supports operations between Complex numbers. We need to add overloaded operators to handle these cases.

Let's add the following operators:
1. Complex + double
2. double + Complex
3. Complex - double
4. double - Complex
5. Complex * double
6. double * Complex
7. Complex / double
8. double / Complex

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
=======
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Overloads for operations with doubles
    Complex operator+(double other) const;
    Complex operator-(double other) const;
    Complex operator*(double other) const;
    Complex operator/(double other) const;
    
    friend Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these in the source file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    // (a + bi)/(c + di) = [(ac + bd)/(c^2 + d^2)] + [(bc - ad)/(c^2 + d^2)]i
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
=======
Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    // (a + bi)/(c + di) = [(ac + bd)/(c^2 + d^2)] + [(bc - ad)/(c^2 + d^2)]i
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

// Implement operations with doubles
Complex Complex::operator+(double other) const {
    return Complex(real_ + other, imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(double other) const {
    return Complex(real_ - other, imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(double other) const {
    return Complex(real_ * other, imag_ * other);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(double other) const {
    return Complex(real_ / other, imag_ / other);
}

// Friend functions for operations where double is on the left
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs + rhs.real_, rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs - rhs.real_, -rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs * rhs.real_, lhs * rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To compute lhs / (a + bi), which is the same as lhs * conjugate / (a^2 + b^2)
    double denominator = (rhs.real_ * rhs.real_) + (rhs.imag_ * rhs.imag_);
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real_) / denominator, (-lhs * rhs.imag_) / denominator);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, we need to declare these friend functions in the class to access private members. Let's make sure they're properly declared in the header:

Wait, we already added the friend declarations in the header. Now we need to implement them in the source file.

This implementation should now handle all the cases where doubles are mixed with Complex numbers:
1. Complex + double: uses the member function
2. double + Complex: uses the friend function
3. And similarly for other operations

Let's test if this resolves the errors:
- When the test does `c + 5.0`, it will use the member function `operator+(double)`
- When the test does `5.0 + c`, it will use the friend function `operator+(double, const Complex&)`
- And similarly for other operations

This should now compile and work correctly. Let's hope this fixes all the errors.

I see the issue. The implementation of `operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs)` is incorrect. When subtracting a complex number from a double, it should be `(lhs - rhs.real_) + (-rhs.imag_)i`, not `(lhs - rhs.real_, -rhs.imag_)`.

Here's the fix:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs - rhs.real_, -rhs.imag_);
}
=======
Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs - rhs.real_, -rhs.imag_);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Wait, that's actually correct. The real part is `lhs - rhs.real_` and the imaginary part is `-rhs.imag_`. But perhaps there's another issue.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Let's think about `a - (b + ci) = (a - b) - ci`, which matches our implementation:
real part: a - b
imaginary part: -c

This seems correct. Maybe there's another error.

Perhaps the tests are expecting exact floating point values, and there are precision issues. But the error messages would be different.

Wait, the implementation of `operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs)` might be incorrect. Let's double-check:
lhs / (a + bi) = lhs * (a - bi) / (a² + b²) = (lhs*a/(a² + b²)) + (-lhs*b/(a² + b²))i
Which matches our implementation:
real part: (lhs * rhs.real_) / denominator
imag part: (-lhs * rhs.imag_) / denominator

This seems correct too.

Perhaps the issue is that the implementation needs to be in the namespace. Let's make sure all operators are within the complex_numbers namespace.

Wait, the friend functions are declared within the class, which is in the namespace, so they should be in the namespace too. But when implementing them, we need to specify the namespace.

Let's fix the implementation to explicitly be in the namespace:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Friend functions for operations where double is on the left
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs + rhs.real_, rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs - rhs.real_, -rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs * rhs.real_, lhs * rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To compute lhs / (a + bi), which is the same as lhs * conjugate / (a^2 + b^2)
    double denominator = (rhs.real_ * rhs.real_) + (rhs.imag_ * rhs.imag_);
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real_) / denominator, (-lhs * rhs.imag_) / denominator);
}
=======
// Friend functions for operations where double is on the left
namespace complex_numbers {

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs + rhs.real_, rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs - rhs.real_, -rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs * rhs.real_, lhs * rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To compute lhs / (a + bi), which is the same as lhs * conjugate / (a^2 + b^2)
    double denominator = (rhs.real_ * rhs.real_) + (rhs.imag_ * rhs.imag_);
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real_) / denominator, (-lhs * rhs.imag_) / denominator);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This ensures that the operators are in the same namespace as the Complex class, which is important for argument-dependent lookup (ADL).

This should now resolve any issues where the operators can't be found when mixing doubles with Complex numbers. Let's hope this fixes the remaining issues.
