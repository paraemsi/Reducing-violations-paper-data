Please create succinct, bullet-point instructions for a programmer, distilling the most important information from the rule.
It should tell the programmer how to generate code that respects the above
rule.
It should be in a short form similar to:
- do not ..., use ... instead
or
- ... should not be used, please ... instead
- example: instead of ... use ...

Make sure the instructions are clear, succinct and actionable and cover the most important aspects of the rule rather than every minor detail.
Please output only the uninterrupted bullet-point instructions, without any additional text or explanations.
