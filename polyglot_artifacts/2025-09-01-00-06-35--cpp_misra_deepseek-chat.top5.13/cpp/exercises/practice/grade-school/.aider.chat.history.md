#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.  
####   
#### In the end, you should be able to:  
####   
#### - Add a student's name to the roster for a grade  
####   - "Add Jim to grade 2."  
####   - "OK."  
#### - Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade  
####   - "Which students are in grade 2?"  
####   - "We've only got Jim just now."  
#### - Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  
####   Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.  
####   - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"  
####   - "Let me think.  
####     We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.  
####     So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"  
####   
#### Note that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.  
#### In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grade_school.h grade_school.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. We need to implement a school roster system that can add students to grades and retrieve them in a sorted manner. Let's think through this carefully.

Since grades are numbers and names are strings, we need a data structure that can map grades to lists of names, and ensure that:
1. When adding a student, if they're already in the grade, it should be considered an error
2. All retrievals should be sorted appropriately

However, the instructions don't specify how to indicate when adding a duplicate student is incorrect. Since this is C++, we can throw an exception or return a boolean. But the instructions say to "indicate that this is incorrect", which is a bit vague. Let's assume we need to throw an exception.

Wait, the note says "your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect", which could mean throwing an exception or returning a status. Since the function signatures aren't specified, we need to define them.

Let's define the interface in the header file first.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a class `school` to manage the roster
2. Add a method to add a student to a grade, which throws if the student is already in that grade
3. Add a method to get all students in a grade, sorted alphabetically
4. Add a method to get all students across all grades, sorted by grade and then alphabetically within each grade

Since we need to sort students, we'll use `std::vector` and `std::sort`
Since we need to map grades to students, we'll use `std::map`

However, we need to be careful about using standard integer types. Let's use `std::uint32_t` from `<cstdint>`

Here are the necessary changes:

grade_school.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(GRADE_SCHOOL_H)
#define GRADE_SCHOOL_H

namespace grade_school {

}  // namespace grade_school

#endif // GRADE_SCHOOL_H
=======
#if !defined(GRADE_SCHOOL_H)
#define GRADE_SCHOOL_H

#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

namespace grade_school {

class school {
private:
    std::map<std::uint32_t, std::vector<std::string>> roster_;
public:
    void add(const std::string& name, std::uint32_t grade);
    const std::map<std::uint32_t, std::vector<std::string>>& roster() const;
    std::vector<std::string> grade(std::uint32_t grade_num) const;
};

}  // namespace grade_school

#endif // GRADE_SCHOOL_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in grade_school.cpp:

grade_school.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "grade_school.h"

namespace grade_school {

}  // namespace grade_school
=======
#include "grade_school.h"
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace grade_school {

void school::add(const std::string& name, std::uint32_t grade) {
    // Check if the student is already in the grade
    auto it = roster_.find(grade);
    if (it != roster_.end()) {
        const auto& students = it->second;
        if (std::find(students.begin(), students.end(), name) != students.end()) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Student already exists in this grade");
        }
    }
    
    // Add the student to the grade
    roster_[grade].push_back(name);
    // Sort the students in the grade alphabetically
    std::sort(roster_[grade].begin(), roster_[grade].end());
}

const std::map<std::uint32_t, std::vector<std::string>>& school::roster() const {
    return roster_;
}

std::vector<std::string> school::grade(std::uint32_t grade_num) const {
    auto it = roster_.find(grade_num);
    if (it != roster_.end()) {
        return it->second;
    }
    return {};
}

}  // namespace grade_school
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The implementation needs to always keep students sorted when adding them
2. The `roster()` method returns a reference to the internal data structure, which should be fine since it's const
3. The `grade()` method returns a copy of the students in that grade, which is appropriate
4. We throw `std::runtime_error` when trying to add a duplicate student, which indicates the operation is incorrect

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
- Adding students to grades
- Getting all students in a grade (always sorted)
- Getting all students across all grades (the map is ordered by grade number, and students within each grade are sorted)
- Preventing duplicate additions by throwing an exception

However, the instructions don't specify exact function signatures, so we need to make sure these match what's expected by any tests. Since the user mentioned not to change existing functions or classes, but there were none to begin with, this should be fine.

I understand. The issue is with using `std::uint32_t` which violates the MISRA C++ rules provided. We need to use a typedef/using alias for a fixed-width type instead. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Create a type alias for the grade type
2. Use this alias throughout the interface
3. Make sure to include <cstdint>

Here are the fixes:

grade_school.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(GRADE_SCHOOL_H)
#define GRADE_SCHOOL_H

#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

namespace grade_school {

class school {
private:
    std::map<std::uint32_t, std::vector<std::string>> roster_;
public:
    void add(const std::string& name, std::uint32_t grade);
    const std::map<std::uint32_t, std::vector<std::string>>& roster() const;
    std::vector<std::string> grade(std::uint32_t grade_num) const;
};

}  // namespace grade_school

#endif // GRADE_SCHOOL_H
=======
#if !defined(GRADE_SCHOOL_H)
#define GRADE_SCHOOL_H

#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

namespace grade_school {

// Alias for grade type to comply with MISRA rules
using grade_t = std::uint32_t;

class school {
private:
    std::map<grade_t, std::vector<std::string>> roster_;
public:
    void add(const std::string& name, grade_t grade);
    const std::map<grade_t, std::vector<std::string>>& roster() const;
    std::vector<std::string> grade(grade_t grade_num) const;
};

}  // namespace grade_school

#endif // GRADE_SCHOOL_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, we need to update the implementation to use the alias:

grade_school.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "grade_school.h"
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace grade_school {

void school::add(const std::string& name, std::uint32_t grade) {
    // Check if the student is already in the grade
    auto it = roster_.find(grade);
    if (it != roster_.end()) {
        const auto& students = it->second;
        if (std::find(students.begin(), students.end(), name) != students.end()) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Student already exists in this grade");
        }
    }
    
    // Add the student to the grade
    roster_[grade].push_back(name);
    // Sort the students in the grade alphabetically
    std::sort(roster_[grade].begin(), roster_[grade].end());
}

const std::map<std::uint32_t, std::vector<std::string>>& school::roster() const {
    return roster_;
}

std::vector<std::string> school::grade(std::uint32_t grade_num) const {
    auto it = roster_.find(grade_num);
    if (it != roster_.end()) {
        return it->second;
    }
    return {};
}

}  // namespace grade_school
=======
#include "grade_school.h"
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace grade_school {

void school::add(const std::string& name, grade_t grade) {
    // Check if the student is already in the grade
    auto it = roster_.find(grade);
    if (it != roster_.end()) {
        const auto& students = it->second;
        if (std::find(students.begin(), students.end(), name) != students.end()) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Student already exists in this grade");
        }
    }
    
    // Add the student to the grade
    roster_[grade].push_back(name);
    // Sort the students in the grade alphabetically
    std::sort(roster_[grade].begin(), roster_[grade].end());
}

const std::map<grade_t, std::vector<std::string>>& school::roster() const {
    return roster_;
}

std::vector<std::string> school::grade(grade_t grade_num) const {
    auto it = roster_.find(grade_num);
    if (it != roster_.end()) {
        return it->second;
    }
    return {};
}

}  // namespace grade_school
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that we're using a type alias `grade_t` instead of directly using `std::uint32_t`, which complies with the MISRA C++ rules provided. The functionality remains the same, but now it's more appropriate according to the guidelines.

I understand. The issue is that we're still using `std::uint32_t` directly in the alias, which violates the MISRA rule: "The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used". We need to use fixed-width types from `<cstdint>` instead.

Wait, but `std::uint32_t` is a fixed-width type from `<cstdint>`, which should be fine according to the rules:
"Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, etc."

But the rule says "The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used", which refers to types like `unsigned int`, `long`, etc. `std::uint32_t` is not a standard type name, it's a fixed-width type alias from `<cstdint>`.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the rule says "The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used", and then lists examples including `unsigned int`, `long`, etc. But `std::uint32_t` is not in that list.

However, to be absolutely sure, let's use the fixed-width types directly without creating an alias that uses the standard type names. But `grade_t` is our own alias, which is fine.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the rule says not to use the standard type names, and `std::uint32_t` is not a standard type name, it's a fixed-width type from the standard library. So this should be fine.

But to be extra careful, let's use the fixed-width type directly without an alias:

Wait, the rules say:
"If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)"

So we're doing it correctly by using an alias. But perhaps the issue is that the alias name `grade_t` should be used consistently.

Wait, the error markers are on lines that use `grade_t`, which suggests that the issue might be elsewhere. Maybe the implementation needs to be checked.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Let's make sure all the function signatures match exactly between the header and implementation.

Wait, the implementation uses `grade_t` which is defined in the header, and we're including the header, so that should be fine.

Perhaps the issue is that the implementation needs to be in the same namespace? But it is.

Wait, let's make sure all the function signatures match exactly. They do.

Perhaps the issue is with the use of `std::runtime_error` which may need to be fully qualified or have its header included. Let's add `<stdexcept>` to the header if it's not there.

Wait, it's already included in the implementation file.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the error is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the `roster()` method returns a reference to the internal data structure, which could be considered bad practice, but that's not what the instructions say.

Since I can't see the actual error, I'll assume everything is correct and the implementation matches the requirements.

However, to be thorough, let's make sure all the MISRA rules are followed:
1. We're using fixed-width types through an alias
2. No standard integer type names are used directly
3. All function parameters and return types use appropriate types

This implementation should be correct. If there are specific errors, please provide more details.
