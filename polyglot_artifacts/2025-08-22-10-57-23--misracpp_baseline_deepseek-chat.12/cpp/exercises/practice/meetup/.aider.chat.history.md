#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Every month, your partner meets up with their best friend.  
#### Both of them have very busy schedules, making it challenging to find a suitable date!  
#### Given your own busy schedule, your partner always double-checks potential meetup dates with you:  
####   
#### - "Can I meet up on the first Friday of next month?"  
#### - "What about the third Wednesday?"  
#### - "Maybe the last Sunday?"  
####   
#### In this month's call, your partner asked you this question:  
####   
#### - "I'd like to meet up on the teenth Thursday; is that okay?"  
####   
#### Confused, you ask what a "teenth" day is.  
#### Your partner explains that a teenth day, a concept they made up, refers to the days in a month that end in '-teenth':  
####   
#### - 13th (thirteenth)  
#### - 14th (fourteenth)  
#### - 15th (fifteenth)  
#### - 16th (sixteenth)  
#### - 17th (seventeenth)  
#### - 18th (eighteenth)  
#### - 19th (nineteenth)  
####   
#### As there are also seven weekdays, it is guaranteed that each day of the week has _exactly one_ teenth day each month.  
####   
#### Now that you understand the concept of a teenth day, you check your calendar.  
#### You don't have anything planned on the teenth Thursday, so you happily confirm the date with your partner.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to find the exact date of a meetup, given a month, year, weekday and week.  
####   
#### There are five week values to consider: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, `last`, `teenth`.  
####   
#### For example, you might be asked to find the date for the meetup on the first Monday in January 2018 (January 1, 2018).  
####   
#### Similarly, you might be asked to find:  
####   
#### - the third Tuesday of August 2019 (August 20, 2019)  
#### - the teenth Wednesday of May 2020 (May 13, 2020)  
#### - the fourth Sunday of July 2021 (July 25, 2021)  
#### - the last Thursday of November 2022 (November 24, 2022)  
#### - the teenth Saturday of August 1953 (August 15, 1953)  
####   
#### ## Teenth  
####   
#### The teenth week refers to the seven days in a month that end in '-teenth' (13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th).  
####   
#### If asked to find the teenth Saturday of August, 1953, we check its calendar:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
####     August 1953  
#### Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
####                    1  
####  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  
####  9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
#### 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  
#### 23 24 25 26 27 28 29  
#### 30 31  
#### ```  
####   
#### From this we find that the teenth Saturday is August 15, 1953.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: meetup.h meetup.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I understand. We need to implement a function that can find the exact date for a meetup based on the year, month, weekday, and week specification. Let's think about how to approach this.

Since the function signature isn't provided, I need to add it to the header file. Let's add a class or function to handle this.

Wait, the instructions say not to change the names of existing functions or classes, but the files are empty. So we need to add our implementation.

Let's add a class `scheduler` that can find the date. But the instructions might expect a specific interface. Since this is a coding exercise, it's common to have a function that takes these parameters and returns a `boost::gregorian::date` or similar, but since we're using standard libraries, we'll need to use what's available.

Actually, C++20 has the `<chrono>` library which can handle dates, but it's a bit complex. Let's use a simpler approach by calculating the day of the week.

Wait, the year could be from the past, so we need a reliable way to find the day of the week for any date. Zeller's congruence could help, but it's better to use a library if possible.

Since we're to use standard libraries, and this seems to be a coding challenge, we can implement our own logic to find the day of the week.

But first, let's define the interface. Let's add a function that takes year, month, week, and weekday, and returns a struct containing day, month, year.

Wait, the week and weekday need to be enums or strings. Let's use strings.

Here's the plan:
1. Add necessary includes
2. Define the function signature
3. Implement the logic to find the desired day

Let's start with the header:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

namespace meetup {

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
=======
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <string>

namespace meetup {

class scheduler {
public:
    scheduler(int year, int month);
    int find_day(const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday) const;
    
private:
    int year_;
    int month_;
    int day_of_week(int day) const;
    int parse_weekday(const std::string& weekday) const;
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "meetup.h"

namespace meetup {

}  // namespace meetup
=======
#include "meetup.h"
#include <string>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <array>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

namespace meetup {

scheduler::scheduler(int year, int month) : year_(year), month_(month) {}

int scheduler::find_day(const string& week, const string& weekday) const {
    // Parse the weekday
    int target_dow = parse_weekday(weekday);
    
    if (week == "teenth") {
        // Check days 13-19
        for (int day = 13; day <= 19; day++) {
            if (day_of_week(day) == target_dow) {
                return day;
            }
        }
    } else {
        // For first, second, third, fourth, last
        int week_index;
        if (week == "first") week_index = 0;
        else if (week == "second") week_index = 1;
        else if (week == "third") week_index = 2;
        else if (week == "fourth") week_index = 3;
        else if (week == "last") week_index = -1;
        else throw runtime_error("Invalid week specification");
        
        // Find all days with matching weekday in the month
        // To find the number of days in the month
        array<int, 12> month_days = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
        int days_in_month = month_days[month_ - 1];
        // Adjust for leap year in February
        if (month_ == 2) {
            if ((year_ % 4 == 0 && year_ % 100 != 0) || (year_ % 400 == 0)) {
                days_in_month = 29;
            }
        }
        
        if (week_index != -1) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int day = 1; day <= days_in_month; day++) {
                if (day_of_week(day) == target_dow) {
                    if (count == week_index) {
                        return day;
                    }
                    count++;
                }
            }
        } else {
            // For last, find the last occurrence
            for (int day = days_in_month; day >= 1; day--) {
                if (day_of_week(day) == target_dow) {
                    return day;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    throw runtime_error("No valid day found");
}

int scheduler::day_of_week(int day) const {
    // Using Zeller's Congruence
    int m = month_;
    int y = year_;
    if (m < 3) {
        m += 12;
        y -= 1;
    }
    int k = y % 100;
    int j = y / 100;
    int h = (day + (13*(m + 1))/5 + k + (k/4) + (j/4) + 5*j) % 7;
    // Convert to 0=Saturday, 1=Sunday, ... 6=Friday? We need to map to our own numbering
    // Let's adjust to 0=Sunday to match our parse_weekday
    int dow = (h + 5) % 7;
    return dow;
}

int scheduler::parse_weekday(const string& weekday) const {
    if (weekday == "Sunday") return 0;
    if (weekday == "Monday") return 1;
    if (weekday == "Tuesday") return 2;
    if (weekday == "Wednesday") return 3;
    if (weekday == "Thursday") return 4;
    if (weekday == "Friday") return 5;
    if (weekday == "Saturday") return 6;
    throw runtime_error("Invalid weekday");
}

}  // namespace meetup
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, the user might expect a different interface. Since the instructions don't specify, I've created a class that takes year and month in the constructor, and then find_day can be called with week and weekday.

Wait, the examples show:
- first Monday in January 2018
This would be:
scheduler s(2018, 1);
int day = s.find_day("first", "Monday");

This seems to match.

This implementation should work:
1. For teenth: check days 13-19 to find the one that matches the target weekday
2. For first through fourth: count occurrences of the target weekday and pick the appropriate one
3. For last: find the last occurrence of the target weekday in the month

Note: Zeller's congruence is used to find the day of the week, which is reliable for the Gregorian calendar.
The adjustment (h + 5) % 7 maps the result to 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc., which matches our parse_weekday implementation.

This implementation should handle all the provided examples correctly. Let's test the examples:
- first Monday in January 2018: January 1, 2018 is a Monday
- third Tuesday of August 2019: August 20, 2019 is a Tuesday
- teenth Wednesday of May 2020: May 13, 2020 is a Wednesday
- fourth Sunday of July 2021: July 25, 2021 is a Sunday
- last Thursday of November 2022: November 24, 2022 is a Thursday
- teenth Saturday of August 1953: August 15, 1953 is a Saturday

This seems correct. Let's proceed with this implementation.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to match the expected interface. Since the function names and class structure are fixed, we need to ensure they're correct. However, the provided implementation uses a class called `scheduler`, which may not be what's expected.

Wait, the instructions say not to change the names of existing functions or classes, but the files were initially empty. So perhaps there's a standard interface expected for this problem.

Actually, looking at common meetup problems, there's often a function that directly returns the date. Let's think about a more standard approach.

Perhaps the interface should be:
boost::gregorian::date meetup::day(int year, int month, const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday)

But since we're to use standard libraries, and boost is not standard, we need to find another approach.

Wait, the instructions don't specify the return type, so we need to return a date-like structure. Since the year and month are given, we just need to find the day and construct a date.

But the function signature in the header shows `find_day` returns an `int`, which is the day of the month. That seems fine.

However, the implementation needs to be correct. Let's test Zeller's congruence:
The formula is:
h = (q + floor(13*(m+1)/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5*J) mod 7

Where:
h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)
q is the day of the month
m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)
K the year of the century (year mod 100)
J is the zero-based century (floor(year/100))

But in our implementation, we need to map this to 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc.
So we can adjust by doing (h + 6) % 7 to get 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc.

Wait, the current implementation uses (h + 5) % 7 which may be incorrect.

Let's test with a known date: January 1, 2018 which was a Monday
According to our parse_weekday, Monday is 1

Using Zeller's:
m = 13 (since January is treated as month 13 of the previous year)
y = 2017
q = 1
k = 17
j = 20
h = (1 + 13*14/5 + 17 + 17/4 + 20/4 + 5*20) % 7
Let's compute step by step:
13*14=182 → 182/5=36.4 → floor is 36
17/4=4.25 → floor is 4
20/4=5
5*20=100
Sum: 1 + 36 + 17 + 4 + 5 + 100 = 163
163 % 7 = 163 - 23*7 = 163 - 161 = 2
Now (2 + 5) % 7 = 0
But we want 1 for Monday

This doesn't match. So there's an error in the adjustment.

Actually, the standard mapping from Zeller's is:
h=0 → Saturday
h=1 → Sunday
...
h=6 → Friday

So to map to our system where Sunday=0, Monday=1, etc., we can use:
dow = (h + 6) % 7
Let's test:
(2 + 6) % 7 = 1 → which matches Monday=1

So we need to change the adjustment to (h + 6) % 7

Here are the necessary fixes:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
int scheduler::day_of_week(int day) const {
    // Using Zeller's Congruence
    int m = month_;
    int y = year_;
    if (m < 3) {
        m += 12;
        y -= 1;
    }
    int k = y % 100;
    int j = y / 100;
    int h = (day + (13*(m + 1))/5 + k + (k/4) + (j/4) + 5*j) % 7;
    // Convert to 0=Saturday, 1=Sunday, ... 6=Friday? We need to map to our own numbering
    // Let's adjust to 0=Sunday to match our parse_weekday
    int dow = (h + 5) % 7;
    return dow;
}
=======
int scheduler::day_of_week(int day) const {
    int m = month_;
    int y = year_;
    if (m < 3) {
        m += 12;
        y -= 1;
    }
    int k = y % 100;
    int j = y / 100;
    int h = (day + 13*(m+1)/5 + k + k/4 + j/4 + 5*j) % 7;
    // Adjust to make 0=Saturday, 1=Sunday, etc. to 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc.
    int dow = (h + 6) % 7;
    return dow;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This should now correctly compute the day of the week. Let's test our example:
January 1, 2018:
h=2 → (2 + 6) % 7 = 1 → which is Monday, matching parse_weekday where Monday=1

This looks correct.

Also, we need to ensure integer division is used consistently. In C++, integer division truncates towards zero, which is what we want.

This implementation should now work for all cases. Let's run through our examples:
1. first Monday in January 2018: day 1 → correct
2. third Tuesday of August 2019: August 20, 2019
3. teenth Wednesday of May 2020: May 13, 2020
4. fourth Sunday of July 2021: July 25, 2021
5. last Thursday of November 2022: November 24, 2022
6. teenth Saturday of August 1953: August 15, 1953

All these should now be computed correctly with the fixed day_of_week function.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in meetup.h meetup.cpp to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests expect specific member functions like `monteenth()`, `first_monday()`, etc. to be present in the `scheduler` class, but our implementation provides a generic `find_day()` function instead. Let's fix this by adding all the required member functions.

Since there are many combinations (7 weekdays × 5 weeks + 7 teenth days = 42 functions), we'll generate them dynamically. But to match the test expectations, we need to implement each one individually.

However, to avoid writing 42 separate functions manually, we can use a helper approach. Let's implement each function to call our existing `find_day()` method with the appropriate parameters.

Here's the plan:
1. Add all the required member functions to the scheduler class
2. Implement each one to call find_day with the correct parameters
3. Make sure the return type matches what the tests expect (probably a date, not an int)

Wait, the tests seem to be comparing with `REQUIRE(expected == meetup.monteenth())`, which suggests they're returning dates, not integers.
Since the tests use Boost, we should return `boost::gregorian::date`.

Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH

};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H

#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <string>
#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>

namespace meetup {

class scheduler {
public:
    scheduler(int year, int month);
    
    // Teenth functions

    int parse_weekday(const std::string& weekday) const;
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation, we need to add all these functions to call find_day and construct a boost::gregorian::date:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "meetup.h"
#include <string>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <array>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

namespace meetup {

scheduler::scheduler(int year, int month) : year_(year), month_(month) {}

int scheduler::find_day(const string& week, const string& weekday) const {
=======
#include "meetup.h"
#include <string>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <array>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

namespace meetup {

scheduler::scheduler(int year, int month) : year_(year), month_(month) {}

// Implement all the member functions
#define IMPLEMENT_TEENTH(day_name, weekday_name) \
boost::gregorian::date scheduler::day_name##teenth() const { \
    int day = find_day("teenth", #weekday_name); \
    return boost::gregorian::date(year_, month_, day); \
}

IMPLEMENT_TEENTH(mon, Monday)
IMPLEMENT_TEENTH(tues, Tuesday)
IMPLEMENT_TEENTH(wednes, Wednesday)
IMPLEMENT_TEENTH(thurs, Thursday)
IMPLEMENT_TEENTH(fri, Friday)
IMPLEMENT_TEENTH(satur, Saturday)
IMPLEMENT_TEENTH(sun, Sunday)

#define IMPLEMENT_WEEK(prefix, week_name, weekday_name) \
boost::gregorian::date scheduler::prefix##_##weekday_name() const { \
    int day = find_day(#week_name, #weekday_name); \
    return boost::gregorian::date(year_, month_, day); \
}

// First week
IMPLEMENT_WEEK(first, first, monday)
IMPLEMENT_WEEK(first, first, tuesday)
IMPLEMENT_WEEK(first, first, wednesday)
IMPLEMENT_WEEK(first, first, thursday)
IMPLEMENT_WEEK(first, first, friday)

IMPLEMENT_WEEK(first, first, sunday)

// Second week

IMPLEMENT_WEEK(last, last, tuesday)
IMPLEMENT_WEEK(last, last, wednesday)
IMPLEMENT_WEEK(last, last, thursday)
IMPLEMENT_WEEK(last, last, friday)
IMPLEMENT_WEEK(last, last, saturday)
IMPLEMENT_WEEK(last, last, sunday)

int scheduler::find_day(const string& week, const string& weekday) const {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation uses macros to generate all the required functions, which will call `find_day` with the appropriate parameters and construct a `boost::gregorian::date` to return. This should now match what the tests expect.

I see the issue. The problem is that the function names in the implementation don't match the declarations in the header file. For example, the header declares `thursteenth()` but the implementation tries to generate `thursThursdayteenth()` which is incorrect.

Let's fix the implementation to match the exact function names:

1. The teenth functions should use the exact names from the header
2. The week functions should use the exact names from the header

Here are the necessary fixes:

meetup.cpp
```cpp

boost::gregorian::date scheduler::day_name##teenth() const { \
    int day = find_day("teenth", #weekday_name); \
    return boost::gregorian::date(year_, month_, day); \
}

IMPLEMENT_TEENTH(mon, Monday)
IMPLEMENT_TEENTH(tues, Tuesday)
IMPLEMENT_TEENTH(wednes, Wednesday)
IMPLEMENT_TEENTH(thurs, Thursday)
IMPLEMENT_TEENTH(fri, Friday)
IMPLEMENT_TEENTH(satur, Saturday)
IMPLEMENT_TEENTH(sun, Sunday)

#define IMPLEMENT_WEEK(prefix, week_name, weekday_name) \
boost::gregorian::date scheduler::prefix##_##weekday_name() const { \
    int day = find_day(#week_name, #weekday_name); \
    return boost::gregorian::date(year_, month_, day); \
}
