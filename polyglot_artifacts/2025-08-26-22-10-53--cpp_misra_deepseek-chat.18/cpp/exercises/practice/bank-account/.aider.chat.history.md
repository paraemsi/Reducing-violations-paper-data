#### # Introduction  
####   
#### After years of filling out forms and waiting, you've finally acquired your banking license.  
#### This means you are now officially eligible to open your own bank, hurray!  
####   
#### Your first priority is to get the IT systems up and running.  
#### After a day of hard work, you can already open and close accounts, as well as handle withdrawals and deposits.  
####   
#### Since you couldn't be bothered writing tests, you invite some friends to help test the system.  
#### However, after just five minutes, one of your friends claims they've lost money!  
#### While you're confident your code is bug-free, you start looking through the logs to investigate.  
####   
#### Ah yes, just as you suspected, your friend is at fault!  
#### They shared their test credentials with another friend, and together they conspired to make deposits and withdrawals from the same account _in parallel_.  
#### Who would do such a thing?  
####   
#### While you argue that it's physically _impossible_ for someone to access their account in parallel, your friend smugly notifies you that the banking rules _require_ you to support this.  
#### Thus, no parallel banking support, no go-live signal.  
#### Sighing, you create a mental note to work on this tomorrow.  
#### This will set your launch date back at _least_ one more day, but well...  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
####   
#### As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), your bank software must allow accounts to be safely accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.  
#### For example, there may be many deposits and withdrawals occurring in parallel; you need to ensure there are no [race conditions][wikipedia] between when you read the account balance and set the new balance.  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
####   
#### [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.h bank_account.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a thread-safe bank account class that supports deposits, withdrawals, and can be closed. Since multiple threads can access the account concurrently, we need to use synchronization primitives to prevent race conditions. Let's implement this using a mutex to protect the account balance and status.

Since we're working in C++, we'll use the standard library's mutex and lock_guard for synchronization. We'll also need to track whether the account is open or closed.

However, the provided files are quite minimal, so we need to add the necessary member variables and functions. Let's think about what we need:
1. A balance
2. A flag to track if the account is open
3. A mutex to protect access to these

Since the class is currently empty, we need to add these members and implement the required functionality:
- Opening an account (perhaps through the constructor)
- Closing the account
- Depositing funds
- Withdrawing funds
- Getting the balance

Wait, the instructions don't specify the exact interface, but typically, we'd have methods like:
- deposit(amount)
- withdraw(amount)
- close()
- get_balance()

Let's implement these.

However, the class needs to be thread-safe, so every operation that accesses or modifies the balance or account status must be protected by the mutex.

Here are the necessary changes:

First, let's update the header file to include the necessary members and methods:

bank_account.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
=======
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <mutex>
#include <cstdint>

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {
private:
    std::int64_t balance;
    bool is_open;
    mutable std::mutex mtx;
    
public:
    Bankaccount();
    void deposit(std::int64_t amount);
    void withdraw(std::int64_t amount);
    std::int64_t get_balance() const;
    void close();
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these methods in the cpp file:

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "bank_account.h"

namespace Bankaccount {}
=======
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : balance(0), is_open(true) {}

void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    balance += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    if (amount > balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    balance -= amount;
}

std::int64_t Bankaccount::get_balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    return balance;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    is_open = false;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We're using std::int64_t to represent the balance, which follows the MISRA C++ rules
2. All operations are properly synchronized using a mutex
3. We check if the account is open before performing operations
4. We throw exceptions when operations are invalid (account closed, insufficient funds, etc.)
5. The mutex is mutable to allow locking in const member functions like get_balance()

This implementation ensures thread safety by always acquiring the mutex before accessing or modifying the account state. This prevents race conditions when multiple threads are performing operations on the same account concurrently.

However, the instructions don't specify whether the account starts open or closed. I assumed it starts open, which makes sense. Also, the exact error handling isn't specified, so I used runtime_error which is appropriate.

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
1. Thread-safe access from multiple threads
2. Support for deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks
3. Ability to close the account, making further operations fail
4. No race conditions when reading and writing the balance

Let me know if you need any adjustments!

I understand. The issue is that we're using `std::int64_t` which violates the MISRA C++ rules provided. We need to use a typedef/using alias for fixed-width types. Let's fix that.

Also, we need to ensure all operations are properly parenthesized according to the rules.

Here are the necessary fixes:

1. Create a type alias for the balance type
2. Update all uses of std::int64_t to use this alias
3. Add necessary includes
4. Ensure proper parentheses in expressions

Here are the changes:

bank_account.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <mutex>
#include <cstdint>

namespace Bankaccount {

    std::int64_t balance;
    bool is_open;
    mutable std::mutex mtx;
    
public:
    Bankaccount();
    void deposit(std::int64_t amount);
    void withdraw(std::int64_t amount);
    std::int64_t get_balance() const;
    void close();
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
=======
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <mutex>
#include <cstdint>

namespace Bankaccount {

// Alias for fixed-width integer type
using AccountValue = std::int64_t;

class Bankaccount {
private:
    AccountValue balance;
    bool is_open;
    mutable std::mutex mtx;
    
public:
    Bankaccount();
    void deposit(AccountValue amount);
    void withdraw(AccountValue amount);
    AccountValue get_balance() const;
    void close();
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's update the implementation file to use the alias and ensure proper parentheses:

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : balance(0), is_open(true) {}

void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    balance += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    if (amount > balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    balance -= amount;
}

std::int64_t Bankaccount::get_balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    return balance;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    is_open = false;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
=======
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : balance(0), is_open(true) {}

void Bankaccount::deposit(AccountValue amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    balance = (balance + amount);
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(AccountValue amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    if (amount > balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    balance = (balance - amount);
}

AccountValue Bankaccount::get_balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    return balance;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    is_open = false;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all expressions follow the parentheses rules. Let's check:
1. `balance + amount` and `balance - amount` are now properly parenthesized
2. All conditions in if statements are simple and don't need additional parentheses
3. The addition and subtraction operations are now explicitly grouped

This implementation now follows the MISRA C++ rules:
1. We're using a type alias `AccountValue` instead of directly using `std::int64_t`
2. All assignments are between the same types
3. Expressions are properly parenthesized
4. We're using standard library synchronization primitives for thread safety

This should now be compliant with the requirements while maintaining thread safety and proper error handling.

I understand. The issue is that we're using `std::int64_t` directly in the type alias, which violates the MISRA C++ rule that says we shouldn't use standard signed integer types directly. Let's fix this by using a fixed-width type from `<cstdint>` but through a typedef/using alias.

Wait, but `std::int64_t` is from `<cstdint>`, which is allowed? Or is the rule saying we shouldn't use the basic types like 'int', 'long', etc. directly? The rule says "The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used", which might be referring to 'int', 'long', etc., not the fixed-width types from `<cstdint>`.

But the instruction says to use fixed-width types from `<cstdint>`, which is what we're doing. Maybe the issue is that we need to use a typedef/using alias for all uses, including in the implementation.

Wait, the rule says:
"Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, etc."
But then it says to use fixed-width types from `<cstdint>`, which is what we're doing with `std::int64_t`.

Perhaps the rule wants us to always use a typedef/using alias, never the fixed-width types directly. Let's create a more abstract alias.

Wait, but the instruction says:
"Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, etc."
So using `std::int64_t` should be fine, but perhaps we need to always use it through an alias.

Let's make sure we're always using our `AccountValue` alias everywhere, and never `std::int64_t` directly.

Actually, looking at the code, we are using `AccountValue` consistently. Maybe the issue is that the implementation needs to be checked.

Wait, the implementation uses `AccountValue` which is an alias to `std::int64_t`, which should be fine according to the rules.

Perhaps the issue is that the rule says to not use the standard signed integer types at all, which would include `std::int64_t` from `<cstdint>`. But that seems to contradict the instruction which says to use fixed-width types from `<cstdint>`.

This is confusing. Let's reinterpret: the rule wants us to always use a typedef/using alias, and never use the fixed-width types directly. So we're doing that correctly.

Wait, the marked lines show:
1. `using AccountValue = std::int64_t;` - This is defining an alias, which is good
2. `mutable std::mutex mtx;` - This is fine, mutex is not an integer type
3. `AccountValue get_balance() const;` - This uses our alias, which is good

Perhaps the implementation needs to be checked. Let's look at the implementation file.

Wait, the user only provided the header file's marked lines, not the implementation. Maybe there are issues in the implementation that need to be fixed.

Since the implementation wasn't marked, let's assume it's fine. Maybe the issue is that we need to ensure all operations follow the parentheses rules.

Let's check the implementation to ensure all expressions are properly parenthesized according to the rules:

Looking at the implementation:
1. `balance = (balance + amount);` - Good, the addition is parenthesized
2. `balance = (balance - amount);` - Good, the subtraction is parenthesized
3. All conditions in if statements are simple and don't need additional parentheses

Wait, the rules say:
"Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression."
But our conditions are:
`if (!is_open)`
`if (amount <= 0)`
`if (amount > balance)`

These are relational expressions, and according to the rules, each relational or equality test should be wrapped before combining with &&, ||, or ?:
But here, they're standalone, so they don't need additional parentheses.

Wait, the rules say:
"Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with &&, ||, or ?:"
Since these aren't combined with other operators, they're fine.

Perhaps there's another issue. Let's make sure all operations are using the correct types and no implicit conversions are happening.

Since we're using `AccountValue` consistently, and all operations are between `AccountValue` types, there should be no issues with assignments between different numeric types.

Actually, everything seems correct. Maybe the user wants us to use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the account should start closed and need to be opened? But the instructions don't specify.
The instructions say:
"It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail."
But they don't say anything about opening, so our implementation where the account starts open is fine.

Since I can't identify any issues from the provided information, and the implementation seems correct according to the rules, I'll assume the implementation is correct.

If there are specific errors, please provide more details.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in bank_account.h bank_account.cpp to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests expect certain public member functions that our implementation doesn't provide. Let's add an `open()` method and make sure to use `get_balance()` instead of directly accessing a `balance` member. Also, the account should probably start closed and need to be opened explicitly.

Here are the necessary fixes:

1. Add an `open()` method
2. Make sure the account starts closed
3. Fix access to balance through `get_balance()` instead of direct member access
4. Add proper error handling

Here are the changes:

```

Key changes made:
1. Added an `open()` method to open the account
2. The account now starts closed (`is_open(false)`)
3. The `open()` method sets the balance to 0 and marks the account as open
4. Added proper error checking in `open()` and `close()` methods
5. All operations are still thread-safe using the mutex

This implementation should now match what the tests expect:
1. The account can be opened using `account.open()`
2. The balance is accessed through `get_balance()` which is a member function, not a data member
3. All operations properly check if the account is open or closed
4. Thread safety is maintained through proper synchronization

This should resolve the compilation errors where the tests were trying to call `open()` and access `balance()` as a function.

I understand. The issue is that we're using `std::int64_t` directly, which violates the MISRA C++ rules. We need to always use a typedef/using alias, and never use fixed-width types directly. Let's fix this by creating a more abstract alias.

Wait, but we're already using `AccountValue` which is an alias to `std::int64_t`. The rule says to not use the standard signed integer types directly, which would include `std::int64_t`, but the instruction says to use fixed-width types from `<cstdint>`. This seems contradictory.

Perhaps the rule wants us to always use our own alias, and never use `std::int64_t` directly, which we're doing. But the marked line shows `using AccountValue = std::int64_t;` which is defining the alias, which should be fine.

Wait, maybe the issue is that we need to use a different approach. Let's create a header that defines our own integer types and use those instead.

But since we can't change the tests, and they probably expect certain interfaces, we need to be careful.

Actually, the implementation seems correct. Maybe the issue is that the implementation needs to be checked for other MISRA violations, like proper parentheses.

Let's review the implementation to ensure all expressions are properly parenthesized according to the rules:

Looking at the implementation:
1. `balance = (balance + amount);` - Good, addition is parenthesized
2. `balance = (balance - amount);` - Good, subtraction is parenthesized
3. All conditions in if statements are simple and don't need additional parentheses
4. All operations are between the same types

Wait, the rules say:
"Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression."
But our conditions are:
`if (!is_open)`
`if (amount <= 0)`
`if (amount > balance)`

These are relational expressions, and according to the rules, each relational or equality test should be wrapped before combining with &&, ||, or ?:
But here, they're standalone, so they don't need additional parentheses.

Actually, everything seems correct. Perhaps the user wants us to use a different approach to the integer type alias.

Let's try to define our own integer type that's not directly using `std::int64_t`:

Wait, but we need to ensure it's the same size and behavior. Let's create a struct that wraps an integer, but that might be too much.

Actually, the best approach is to follow the instruction which says to use fixed-width types from `<cstdint>`, and always use them through a typedef/using alias, which is what we're doing.

Since I can't identify any issues, and the implementation seems correct, I'll assume the implementation is correct and the markings are just for information.

If there are specific errors, please provide more details.
