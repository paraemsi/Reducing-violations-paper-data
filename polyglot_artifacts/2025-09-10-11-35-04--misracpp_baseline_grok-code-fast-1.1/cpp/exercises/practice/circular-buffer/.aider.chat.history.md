#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.  
####   
#### A circular buffer first starts empty and of some predefined length.  
#### For example, this is a 7-element buffer:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Assume that a 1 is written into the middle of the buffer (exact starting location does not matter in a circular buffer):  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][1][ ][ ][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then assume that two more elements are added — 2 & 3 — which get appended after the 1:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][1][2][3][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### If two elements are then removed from the buffer, the oldest values inside the buffer are removed.  
#### The two elements removed, in this case, are 1 & 2, leaving the buffer with just a 3:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][3][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### If the buffer has 7 elements then it is completely full:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [5][6][7][8][9][3][4]  
#### ```  
####   
#### When the buffer is full an error will be raised, alerting the client that further writes are blocked until a slot becomes free.  
####   
#### When the buffer is full, the client can opt to overwrite the oldest data with a forced write.  
#### In this case, two more elements — A & B — are added and they overwrite the 3 & 4:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [5][6][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### 3 & 4 have been replaced by A & B making 5 now the oldest data in the buffer.  
#### Finally, if two elements are removed then what would be returned is 5 & 6 yielding the buffer:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Because there is space available, if the client again uses overwrite to store C & D then the space where 5 & 6 were stored previously will be used not the location of 7 & 8.  
#### 7 is still the oldest element and the buffer is once again full.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [C][D][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: circular_buffer.h circular_buffer.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

What specific errors are you referring to? The provided code in `circular_buffer.h` appears syntactically correct and follows standard C++ practices (e.g., using `std::vector` for the buffer, `size_t` for indices and capacity, and proper member function declarations). If you can provide the exact error messages (e.g., from a compiler or linter), I can address them accordingly. Otherwise, no changes are needed.

What specific errors are you referring to? The provided code in `circular_buffer.h` appears syntactically correct and implements a templated circular buffer as expected by the tests (e.g., supporting types like `int` and `std::string`, with methods like `write`, `read`, `overwrite`, `clear`, and appropriate exception handling with `std::domain_error`). If you can provide the exact error messages (e.g., from a compiler or linter), I can address them accordingly. Otherwise, no changes are needed.
