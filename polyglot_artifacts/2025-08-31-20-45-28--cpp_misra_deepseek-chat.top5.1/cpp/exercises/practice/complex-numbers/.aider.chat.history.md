#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.  
####   
#### `a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.  
#### The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.  
#### The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.  
####   
#### The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:  
#### `(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,  
#### `(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.  
####   
#### Multiplication result is by definition  
#### `(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.  
####   
#### The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is  
#### `1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:  
#### `(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Raising e to a complex exponent can be expressed as `e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`, the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,  
#### - conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.  
####   
#### Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: complex_numbers.cpp complex_numbers.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I'll implement a complex number class with the required operations. Let's start by defining the class structure and then implement each operation.

Since we need to represent complex numbers, we'll use doubles for the real and imaginary parts. Let's implement:

1. Constructor to initialize real and imaginary parts
2. Operations: +, -, *, /
3. Member functions: conjugate(), abs(), exp()

Wait, the instructions say to implement exponent of a complex number, which seems to mean e^z where z is complex.
But the implementation can use Euler's formula: e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))

Here are the implementations:

First, let's update the header file to define the Complex class:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    
    // Overload operators
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the methods in the cpp file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "complex_numbers.h"

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
#include "complex_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

Complex::Complex(double real, double imag) : real_(real), imag_(imag) {}

double Complex::real() const {
    return real_;
}

double Complex::imag() const {
    return imag_;
}

Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_, -imag_);
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex(magnitude * std::cos(imag_), magnitude * std::sin(imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_ + other.real_, imag_ + other.imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_ - other.real_, imag_ - other.imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    // (a + bi)*(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (real_ * other.imag_) + (imag_ * other.real_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    // (a + bi)/(c + di) = [(ac + bd)/(c^2 + d^2)] + [(bc - ad)/(c^2 + d^2)]i
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all operations follow the MISRA C++ rules:
1. No use of standard integer types - We're using double which is fine
2. Appropriate assignments - All assignments are between doubles
3. Parentheses to indicate precedence - Added where necessary
4. Compound statements for if/else - No if/else statements in this implementation
5. No numerical value of characters - Not using any characters

Wait, the implementation looks good. Let's test if it meets all requirements:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division: implemented via operator overloading
- Conjugate: conj() method
- Absolute value: abs() method
- Exponent: exp() method

This implementation should work. Let's proceed.

I understand. The issue is that the implementation needs to match the interface expected by the tests. The tests are probably expecting certain member function names, and we need to ensure they match. Let's fix that.

Looking at the provided code, it seems the implementation may not match what the tests expect. The tests might be using different function names. Let's adjust to use the exact names:
- `conj()` -> `conjugate()`
- `abs()` -> `abs()`
- `exp()` -> `exp()`

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but perhaps the tests expect different names. Let's make sure:
1. The tests might expect `real` and `imag` to be properties, not functions
2. But in C++, we can't have properties directly, so they're probably functions
3. The implementation uses `real()` and `imag()` which matches

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the issue is that the tests expect non-member functions or a different interface.

Since the instructions say not to change existing function names, and the implementation seems to match, perhaps there's another issue.

Wait, the implementation needs to be in a namespace, which it is. Let's make sure all operations are correctly implemented.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Let's run through each operation:
1. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division: implemented via operator overloads
2. Conjugate: conj() -> but the tests might expect conjugate()
3. Absolute value: abs()
4. Exponent: exp()

Wait, the instructions say to implement:
- conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number

But the implementation uses `conj()` which might need to be `conjugate()`

Let's fix that:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    
    // Overload operators
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
=======
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    Complex conjugate() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    
    // Overload operators
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_, -imag_);
}
=======
Complex Complex::conjugate() const {
    return Complex(real_, -imag_);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures we're using `conjugate()` instead of `conj()`, which might be what the tests expect.

Wait, the implementation of `abs()` and `exp()` seems correct. Let's make sure all operations are properly parenthesized according to MISRA rules:
1. All binary operations need proper parentheses
2. Let's check each implementation

Wait, the implementation seems to already have proper parentheses:
- `abs()`: `(real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_)` - good
- Multiplication: `(real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_)` - good
- Division: `((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator` - good

This implementation should now be correct. Let's hope this matches what the tests expect.

I understand. The implementation needs to match what the tests expect. Since the tests are not shown, I need to ensure that the implementation follows best practices and the instructions precisely.

However, the implementation looks correct. Let's check if there are any issues:
1. All operations are implemented
2. The interface matches
3. The implementation follows mathematical formulas

Wait, perhaps the tests expect the operators to be non-member functions. But the instructions say not to change existing function names, and the operators are implemented as member functions which is valid.

Wait, the implementation of division might have an issue with the order of terms for the imaginary part:
The formula is (bc - ad)/(c² + d²), but in the implementation, it's (imag_ * other.real_ - real_ * other.imag_) which matches.

Wait, perhaps the tests expect certain precision or handling of edge cases. Let's make sure division by zero is handled, but since the instructions don't specify, we'll assume valid inputs.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Let's run through each operation to make sure:
1. Addition: real + real, imag + imag
2. Subtraction: real - real, imag - imag
3. Multiplication: (a*c - b*d) + (a*d + b*c)i
4. Division: ((a*c + b*d)/(c² + d²)) + ((b*c - a*d)/(c² + d²))i
5. Conjugate: a - bi
6. Absolute value: sqrt(a² + b²)
7. Exponent: e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))

All seem correct.

Wait, perhaps the tests expect the real() and imag() functions to be named differently, but the interface shows them as is.

Since I can't see the actual errors, I'll assume the implementation is correct and the tests will work with it. If there are specific errors, please share them.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in complex_numbers.cpp complex_numbers.h to resolve the errors.  

I understand the issues. The tests expect:
1. `conj()` instead of `conjugate()`
2. Operators that work with doubles on either side
3. Non-member operators for some cases

Let's fix these issues:

1. Rename `conjugate()` to `conj()`
2. Add non-member operator overloads to handle operations with doubles
3. Make sure all operators are properly implemented

Here are the necessary changes:

    // Overload operators

```

These changes should now handle:
1. The `conj()` member function that the tests expect
2. Operations between Complex numbers and doubles on both sides
3. Proper implementation of all mathematical operations

The implementation for `operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs)` uses the formula:
lhs / (a + bi) = lhs * (a - bi) / (a² + b²) = (lhs*a)/(a² + b²) + (-lhs*b)/(a² + b²)i

This should now pass all the test cases. Let's hope this resolves the compilation errors.

I see the issue. There's an extra closing brace and semicolon on line 37 which is causing a syntax error. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    
    // Overload operators
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    Complex operator+(double other) const;
    Complex operator-(double other) const;
    Complex operator*(double other) const;
    Complex operator/(double other) const;
};

// Non-member operators to handle double on the left side
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    
    // Overload operators
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    Complex operator+(double other) const;
    Complex operator-(double other) const;
    Complex operator*(double other) const;
    Complex operator/(double other) const;
};

// Non-member operators to handle double on the left side
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change removes the extra `};` on line 37 which was likely causing a syntax error. Now the namespace is properly closed with a single `}`.

I see the issue. The non-member operator declarations are inside the `complex_numbers` namespace, which is correct, but their implementations in the .cpp file are also nested within the namespace, which might be causing issues. Let's fix that.

Wait, the implementation in the .cpp file has an extra nested namespace block which is redundant. Let's remove that.

Here are the necessary fixes:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Non-member operator implementations
namespace complex_numbers {

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs + rhs.real(), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs - rhs.real(), -rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs * rhs.real(), lhs * rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To compute lhs / (a + bi), which is lhs * conjugate / (a^2 + b^2)
    double denominator = (rhs.real() * rhs.real()) + (rhs.imag() * rhs.imag());
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real()) / denominator, (-lhs * rhs.imag()) / denominator);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
// Non-member operator implementations
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs + rhs.real(), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs - rhs.real(), -rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs * rhs.real(), lhs * rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To compute lhs / (a + bi), which is lhs * conjugate / (a^2 + b^2)
    double denominator = (rhs.real() * rhs.real()) + (rhs.imag() * rhs.imag());
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real()) / denominator, (-lhs * rhs.imag()) / denominator);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change removes the redundant nested namespace block around the non-member operator implementations. Now, these functions are directly within the `complex_numbers` namespace, which matches their declarations in the header file.

This should resolve any linking issues related to these operators. Let's hope this fixes the remaining errors.
