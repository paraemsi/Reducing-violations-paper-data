#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of [perfect](#perfect), [abundant](#abundant), or [deficient](#deficient) based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The _aliquot sum_ is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of `15` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.  
####   
#### ## Perfect  
####   
#### A number is perfect when it equals its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `6` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`  
#### - `28` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`  
####   
#### ## Abundant  
####   
#### A number is abundant when it is less than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `12` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
#### - `24` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36`  
####   
#### ## Deficient  
####   
#### A number is deficient when it is greater than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `8` is a deficient number because `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`  
#### - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is [perfect](#perfect).  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is [abundant](#abundant) or [deficient](#deficient).

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: perfect_numbers.cpp perfect_numbers.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a classification for numbers based on their aliquot sum. Let's think through this carefully.

Since we need to determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient, we'll need a function that can classify a number into one of these categories. The function should take a number and return its classification.

However, the instructions don't specify the exact function signature, but since this is C++, we'll need to define it in the namespace. Let's assume we need to implement a function that takes an integer and returns an enumeration or some type indicating the classification.

Since the provided files are nearly empty, we need to add the necessary implementation. Let's define an enumeration type for the classification and a function to determine the classification.

Wait, the aliquot sum needs to be calculated by summing all proper divisors of the number (excluding the number itself). So for a number n, we need to find all divisors where 1 <= i < n that divide n exactly.

However, we need to be efficient, especially for large numbers. We can iterate up to the square root of n to find divisors.

Let's implement this:

Wait, the instructions say to use fixed-width integer types, so we'll use std::int64_t.

Here's the plan:
1. Add necessary includes
2. Define an enumeration for classification
3. Implement a function to classify numbers

Here are the necessary changes:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int64_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in perfect_numbers.cpp:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to include <stdexcept> for std::domain_error
2. We need to handle numbers <= 0 by throwing an exception
3. We need to be careful with integer types to follow the rules
4. The implementation uses an efficient approach to find divisors by iterating up to the square root

This implementation should work for the classification:
- Perfect: aliquot sum equals the number
- Abundant: aliquot sum is greater than the number
- Deficient: aliquot sum is less than the number

However, the instructions say to determine if a number is perfect, but then mention that depending on the language track, we may need to implement classification for abundant and deficient as well. Since we're implementing a classification function that can handle all three, this should be fine.

This implementation should be efficient and follow the rules provided. Let's test the implementation with the provided examples:
- 6: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 → perfect
- 28: 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28 → perfect
- 12: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 → abundant
- 24: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36 → abundant
- 8: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 → deficient
- Primes: 1 + ... → always 1, which is less than the number → deficient

This matches the examples provided.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle the requirements. Let's fix the issues:

1. The function signature in the header and implementation must match
2. We need to ensure all types are appropriate
3. The implementation needs to be correct

However, the implementation seems correct, but perhaps there are issues with integer types or other constraints. Let's make sure to follow the rules:
1. Use fixed-width integer types
2. Add necessary parentheses to expressions
3. Handle type conversions properly

Wait, the number could be large, so using std::int64_t is appropriate. Let's fix the implementation to ensure it follows all the rules.

Here are the necessary fixes:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case (its only proper divisor is none, sum is 0 which is less than 1)
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor
    // Calculate the integer square root
    std::int64_t sqrt_number = static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number));
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= sqrt_number; ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but perhaps there are issues with parentheses to follow the rules:
1. Always parenthesize binary operations when they are part of other operations
2. Ensure all expressions are properly parenthesized

However, looking at the implementation, all expressions seem to be properly parenthesized:
- (number % i) == 0
- other_divisor != i
- sum == number
- sum > number

These are all properly parenthesized where necessary.

Wait, the number 1's aliquot sum should be 0, which is less than 1, making it deficient, which matches our implementation.

This implementation should now be correct and follow all the rules:
1. Using fixed-width integer types
2. Proper parentheses
3. No mixed type assignments
4. All conversions are explicit with static_cast

This should now work for all cases:
- Perfect numbers: 6, 28, etc.
- Abundant numbers: 12, 24, etc.
- Deficient numbers: 1, 8, primes, etc.

Let's run through some examples:
1. number = 6: divisors are 1, 2, 3 → sum = 6 → perfect
2. number = 28: divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 → sum = 28 → perfect
3. number = 12: divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → sum = 16 → abundant
4. number = 1: no divisors → sum = 0 → deficient

This matches our expectations.
