#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Every month, your partner meets up with their best friend.  
#### Both of them have very busy schedules, making it challenging to find a suitable date!  
#### Given your own busy schedule, your partner always double-checks potential meetup dates with you:  
####   
#### - "Can I meet up on the first Friday of next month?"  
#### - "What about the third Wednesday?"  
#### - "Maybe the last Sunday?"  
####   
#### In this month's call, your partner asked you this question:  
####   
#### - "I'd like to meet up on the teenth Thursday; is that okay?"  
####   
#### Confused, you ask what a "teenth" day is.  
#### Your partner explains that a teenth day, a concept they made up, refers to the days in a month that end in '-teenth':  
####   
#### - 13th (thirteenth)  
#### - 14th (fourteenth)  
#### - 15th (fifteenth)  
#### - 16th (sixteenth)  
#### - 17th (seventeenth)  
#### - 18th (eighteenth)  
#### - 19th (nineteenth)  
####   
#### As there are also seven weekdays, it is guaranteed that each day of the week has _exactly one_ teenth day each month.  
####   
#### Now that you understand the concept of a teenth day, you check your calendar.  
#### You don't have anything planned on the teenth Thursday, so you happily confirm the date with your partner.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to find the exact date of a meetup, given a month, year, weekday and week.  
####   
#### There are five week values to consider: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, `last`, `teenth`.  
####   
#### For example, you might be asked to find the date for the meetup on the first Monday in January 2018 (January 1, 2018).  
####   
#### Similarly, you might be asked to find:  
####   
#### - the third Tuesday of August 2019 (August 20, 2019)  
#### - the teenth Wednesday of May 2020 (May 13, 2020)  
#### - the fourth Sunday of July 2021 (July 25, 2021)  
#### - the last Thursday of November 2022 (November 24, 2022)  
#### - the teenth Saturday of August 1953 (August 15, 1953)  
####   
#### ## Teenth  
####   
#### The teenth week refers to the seven days in a month that end in '-teenth' (13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th).  
####   
#### If asked to find the teenth Saturday of August, 1953, we check its calendar:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
####     August 1953  
#### Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
####                    1  
####  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  
####  9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
#### 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  
#### 23 24 25 26 27 28 29  
#### 30 31  
#### ```  
####   
#### From this we find that the teenth Saturday is August 15, 1953.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: meetup.cpp meetup.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. We need to implement a function to find the exact date for a meetup based on the given month, year, weekday, and week specification. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the files are provided, I need to add the implementation. Let's see:
1. The function signature isn't shown, but typically it would be something like `date_t meetup(int year, int month, const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday)`
2. We need to find the day of the month that matches:
   - The specified week: first, second, third, fourth, last, teenth
   - The specified weekday: Monday, Tuesday, etc.

However, since the function signature isn't provided, I need to be careful. Let's assume it's in the header.

Wait, the header is empty. So I need to add the function declaration to the header and implementation to the cpp file.

Let's add the necessary includes and implement the logic:
1. For 'teenth', we need to find the day between 13-19 that matches the given weekday
2. For 'first', 'second', etc., we need to find the nth occurrence of the weekday
3. For 'last', find the last occurrence of the weekday in the month

Since we need to work with dates, we can use the C++ <chrono> library which is standard and robust.

However, the instructions say to use standard libraries, and <chrono> is standard in C++11 and later.

Here's the plan:
1. Start from the first day of the month
2. Find the first occurrence of the target weekday
3. Add weeks to reach the desired occurrence (first, second, etc.)
4. For 'teenth', check days 13-19 to find which matches the weekday
5. For 'last', find the last occurrence which could be 4th or 5th

Let's implement:

Wait, first let's add the function declaration to the header:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

namespace meetup {

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
=======
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>

namespace meetup {

class scheduler {
public:
    static boost::gregorian::date meetup(int year, int month, const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday);
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation, we'll use Boost.Date_Time which is a common choice for date manipulation:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "meetup.h"

namespace meetup {

}  // namespace meetup
=======
#include "meetup.h"
#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>
#include <string>
#include <map>
#include <functional>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace meetup {

namespace greg = boost::gregorian;

boost::gregorian::date scheduler::meetup(int year, int month, const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday) {
    // Map weekdays to numbers
    static const std::map<std::string, greg::greg_weekday> weekday_map = {
        {"Monday", greg::Monday},
        {"Tuesday", greg::Tuesday},
        {"Wednesday", greg::Wednesday},
        {"Thursday", greg::Thursday},
        {"Friday", greg::Friday},
        {"Saturday", greg::Saturday},
        {"Sunday", greg::Sunday}
    };
    
    // Get the target weekday
    auto it_weekday = weekday_map.find(weekday);
    if (it_weekday == weekday_map.end()) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid weekday");
    }
    greg::greg_weekday target_weekday = it_weekday->second;
    
    if (week == "teenth") {
        // Check each day from 13 to 19 to find which matches the target weekday
        for (int day = 13; day <= 19; day++) {
            greg::date candidate(year, month, day);
            if (candidate.day_of_week() == target_weekday) {
                return candidate;
            }
        }
    } else {
        // Start from the first day of the month
        greg::date first_of_month(year, month, 1);
        
        // Find the first occurrence of the target weekday
        int days_to_add = (target_weekday.as_number() - first_of_month.day_of_week().as_number() + 7) % 7;
        greg::date first_occurrence = first_of_month + greg::days(days_to_add);
        
        // Handle different week specifications
        if (week == "first") {
            return first_occurrence;
        } else if (week == "second") {
            return first_occurrence + greg::weeks(1);
        } else if (week == "third") {
            return first_occurrence + greg::weeks(2);
        } else if (week == "fourth") {
            return first_occurrence + greg::weeks(3);
        } else if (week == "last") {
            // Add 3 weeks to get to the 4th occurrence, then check if it's still in the same month
            // If not, subtract a week
            greg::date candidate = first_occurrence + greg::weeks(3);
            if ((candidate + greg::weeks(1)).month() == month) {
                return candidate + greg::weeks(1);
            } else {
                return candidate;
            }
        } else {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid week specification");
        }
    }
    throw std::runtime_error("No valid date found");
}

}  // namespace meetup
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue: the 'last' case might not always work correctly. Let's test our approach:
1. Find the first occurrence of the target weekday
2. Add 4 weeks to reach the 5th occurrence, which may be out of the month
3. If it's in the same month, use it, otherwise use the 4th occurrence

Wait, but sometimes there can be 5 occurrences of a weekday in a month
For example, if a month has 31 days and starts on a Friday, there will be 5 Fridays

So for 'last', we need to find the last occurrence which could be the 4th or 5th
Let's always check if adding one more week keeps us in the same month

This implementation should work:
1. Start with the 4th occurrence (first_occurrence + 3 weeks)
2. Check if adding another week is still in the same month
3. If yes, use that, else use the 4th occurrence

This matches our implementation above.

This implementation should handle all cases:
- first, second, third, fourth: straightforward
- last: find the last occurrence which could be 4th or 5th
- teenth: check each day from 13-19

Note: This uses Boost.Date_Time which is a common library, but if it's not available, we might need to use another approach.
Since the instructions say to use standard libraries, and Boost isn't standard, but the tests may be set up to use it.
If there are issues, we may need to use a different approach.

I notice that the implementation uses Boost, but the instructions say to use standard libraries. Let's use the standard <chrono> library which is available in C++20 and later. However, since we don't know the C++ version, and to avoid external dependencies, we need to implement this using standard C++.

Since the implementation needs to find dates, and we can't use Boost, we'll need to implement date calculations manually. Let's use Zeller's congruence or another approach to find weekdays.

Wait, the instructions say to use standard libraries, so we can use the C++11 <chrono> library, but it's a bit tricky to work with dates before C++20. Let's implement our own date functions.

Here's a plan:
1. Implement a function to find the day of the week for any given date
2. Find all dates that match the target weekday in the given month
3. Filter based on the week specification

Let's implement:

First, let's fix the header to not use Boost:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>

namespace meetup {

class scheduler {
public:
    static boost::gregorian::date meetup(int year, int month, const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday);
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
=======
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <string>

namespace meetup {

class scheduler {
public:
    struct date_t {
        int year;
        int month;
        int day;
    };
    static date_t meetup(int year, int month, const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday);
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation, we'll need to find the day of the week. Let's use Zeller's congruence:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "meetup.h"
#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>
#include <string>
#include <map>
#include <functional>

namespace greg = boost::gregorian;

boost::gregorian::date scheduler::meetup(int year, int month, const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday) {
    // Map weekdays to numbers
    static const std::map<std::string, greg::greg_weekday> weekday_map = {
        {"Monday", greg::Monday},
        {"Tuesday", greg::Tuesday},
        {"Wednesday", greg::Wednesday},
        {"Thursday", greg::Thursday},
        {"Friday", greg::Friday},
        {"Saturday", greg::Saturday},
        {"Sunday", greg::Sunday}
    };
    
    // Get the target weekday
    auto it_weekday = weekday_map.find(weekday);
    if (it_weekday == weekday_map.end()) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid weekday");
    }
    greg::greg_weekday target_weekday = it_weekday->second;
    
    if (week == "teenth") {
        // Check each day from 13 to 19 to find which matches the target weekday
        for (int day = 13; day <= 19; day++) {
            greg::date candidate(year, month, day);
            if (candidate.day_of_week() == target_weekday) {
                return candidate;
            }
        }
    } else {
        // Start from the first day of the month
        greg::date first_of_month(year, month, 1);
        
        // Find the first occurrence of the target weekday
        int days_to_add = (target_weekday.as_number() - first_of_month.day_of_week().as_number() + 7) % 7;
        greg::date first_occurrence = first_of_month + greg::days(days_to_add);
        
        // Handle different week specifications
        if (week == "first") {
            return first_occurrence;
        } else if (week == "second") {
            return first_occurrence + greg::weeks(1);
        } else if (week == "third") {
            return first_occurrence + greg::weeks(2);
        } else if (week == "fourth") {
            return first_occurrence + greg::weeks(3);
        } else if (week == "last") {
            // Add 3 weeks to get to the 4th occurrence, then check if it's still in the same month
            // If not, subtract a week
            greg::date candidate = first_occurrence + greg::weeks(3);
            if ((candidate + greg::weeks(1)).month() == month) {
                return candidate + greg::weeks(1);
            } else {
                return candidate;

```

This implementation should work without any external dependencies:
1. `day_of_week` uses Zeller's congruence to find the day of the week (1=Monday, 7=Sunday)
2. `days_in_month` calculates the number of days in a month, accounting for leap years
3. We find all matching weekdays in the month, then pick the appropriate one based on the week specification
4. For 'teenth', we find the day between 13-19 that matches the target weekday

This should handle all the cases mentioned:
- first, second, third, fourth: pick from the list of matching days
- last: pick the last element
- teenth: find the day between 13-19 that's in the matching days list

Note: This implementation assumes there will always be at least 4 occurrences of each weekday in a month, which is true for all months except February which can have 4 or sometimes less, but since we're always finding matching days, it's fine.
For 'teenth', there's always exactly one day between 13-19 that matches each weekday, as per the problem statement.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to use the correct types and follow the MISRA C++ rules. Let's fix that.

Since we need to avoid using raw `int` types, we'll use fixed-width integer types from `<cstdint>`. Also, we need to ensure all operations follow the rules.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Include `<cstdint>` and use fixed-width integer types
2. Add necessary includes
3. Make sure all operations are type-safe

Here are the fixes:

Key changes made:
1. Added parentheses to ensure proper operator precedence according to MISRA rules
2. Changed all `int` types to `std::int32_t`
3. Added necessary include for `<cstdint>`
4. Ensured all operations are type-safe by using consistent types
5. Added parentheses around conditions to make them explicit

This implementation should now follow the MISRA C++ rules while maintaining the same functionality. Let me know if there are any issues.

I see the issues. Let's fix them:

1. The condition in `days_in_month` has incorrect parentheses
2. The function declaration in the header needs to include the `<string>` header

Here are the necessary fixes:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
std::int32_t days_in_month(std::int32_t year, std::int32_t month) {
    if (month == 2) {
        if (((year % 4) == 0) && ((year % 100) != 0)) || ((year % 400) == 0)) {
            return 29;
        } else {
            return 28;
        }
    } else if ((month == 4) || (month == 6) || (month == 9) || (month == 11)) {
        return 30;
    } else {
        return 31;
    }
}
=======
std::int32_t days_in_month(std::int32_t year, std::int32_t month) {
    if (month == 2) {
        if ((((year % 4) == 0) && ((year % 100) != 0)) || ((year % 400) == 0)) {
            return 29;
        } else {
            return 28;
        }
    } else if ((month == 4) || (month == 6) || (month == 9) || (month == 11)) {
        return 30;
    } else {
        return 31;
    }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fixes the parentheses issue in the leap year condition by properly grouping the conditions.

Wait, the header file needs to include `<string>` to use `std::string`, which it already does. So that's fine.

However, the implementation looks correct now. Let's run through the logic:
1. The leap year condition now properly checks if the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, OR if it's divisible by 400
2. All other conditions remain the same

This should now compile and work correctly. Let me know if there are any other issues.

> Finished summarizing chat history.  

I understand. The tests expect a different interface than what we implemented. The tests are calling methods like `monteenth()`, `first_monday()`, etc. on a `scheduler` object that's constructed with a month and year. Let's fix our implementation to match this interface.

Here's what we need to do:
1. The `scheduler` class should have a constructor that takes a month and year
2. It should have member functions for each combination of week and weekday
3. Each member function should return a `boost::gregorian::date`

Since the tests are using Boost, we should use Boost.Date_Time to handle dates.

Here are the necessary changes:

This implementation uses Boost.Date_Time to handle date calculations, which matches what the tests expect. Each member function now properly finds the requested date using the month and year stored in the scheduler instance.

I see the issue. The problem is that the weekday names in the implementation don't match the ones provided by Boost. In Boost, the weekday names are different. Let's fix that.

The Boost weekday names are:
- Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday

But in the implementation, we're trying to use names like `mon`, `tues`, etc. which don't exist.

Let's fix the implementation to use the correct Boost weekday names:

This change explicitly implements each member function using the correct Boost weekday names (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) instead of trying to use macros with incorrect names. This should now compile and work with the tests.
