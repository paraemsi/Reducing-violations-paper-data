#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of [perfect](#perfect), [abundant](#abundant), or [deficient](#deficient) based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The _aliquot sum_ is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of `15` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.  
####   
#### ## Perfect  
####   
#### A number is perfect when it equals its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `6` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`  
#### - `28` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`  
####   
#### ## Abundant  
####   
#### A number is abundant when it is less than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `12` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
#### - `24` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36`  
####   
#### ## Deficient  
####   
#### A number is deficient when it is greater than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `8` is a deficient number because `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`  
#### - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is [perfect](#perfect).  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is [abundant](#abundant) or [deficient](#deficient).

####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: perfect_numbers.h perfect_numbers.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a classification function that determines if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on its aliquot sum. Let's implement this.

Since we need to include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types, we'll need to modify the headers accordingly. Let's implement a function that takes a number and returns its classification.

First, let's update the header file to declare the classification types and function:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int64_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the classify function in the cpp file. We need to calculate the aliquot sum and compare it to the number to determine the classification:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t aliquot_sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            aliquot_sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                aliquot_sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (aliquot_sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (aliquot_sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to include <stdexcept> for std::domain_error
2. We need to include <cmath> for std::sqrt
3. We need to handle edge cases:
   - Numbers <= 0 should throw an exception
   - The number 1 has no proper divisors other than itself, which we don't count, so its aliquot sum is 0, making it deficient
4. We can optimize by only checking up to the square root of the number

This implementation should work efficiently. Let's test the logic:
- For number = 6: divisors are 1, 2, 3 → sum = 6 → perfect
- For number = 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 → sum = 28 → perfect
- For number = 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → sum = 16 → abundant
- For number = 8: 1, 2, 4 → sum = 7 → deficient
- For prime numbers: only 1 is a proper divisor → sum = 1 < number → deficient

This matches the examples provided. Let's proceed with this implementation.

I understand. The issue might be with the implementation. Let me carefully review and fix any potential issues.

The implementation needs to be precise:
1. The aliquot sum should include all proper divisors (excluding the number itself)
2. We need to ensure all cases are handled correctly
3. We need to follow the MISRA C++ rules

Wait, the number 1 is a special case where its only proper divisor is none (since 1 itself is not included), so aliquot sum is 0 which is less than 1 → deficient, which matches our implementation.

However, there might be an issue with integer types and comparisons. Let's make sure we're using the correct types and following the rules.

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but let's make sure:
1. We're not using any standard integer types directly
2. All operations are properly parenthesized
3. No narrowing conversions

Wait, the implementation uses std::int64_t which is from <cstdint>, which is correct.
But let's ensure all expressions are properly parenthesized according to the rules.

Here are the necessary fixes:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t aliquot_sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            aliquot_sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                aliquot_sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (aliquot_sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (aliquot_sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t aliquot_sum = 1;
    std::int64_t sqrt_number = static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number));
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= sqrt_number; ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            aliquot_sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                aliquot_sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (aliquot_sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (aliquot_sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue: when number is a perfect square, we might be adding the square root twice, but our implementation checks if other_divisor != i to prevent that, which is correct.

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but let's make sure all expressions are properly parenthesized according to the rules:
1. The condition (number % i) == 0 is fine
2. Comparisons are fine
3. Arithmetic operations are fine

This implementation should now follow the MISRA C++ rules:
1. Using fixed-width integer types from <cstdint>
2. No mixing of types
3. Proper parenthesization
4. No narrowing conversions

Let's also make sure the header file is correct. The header looks fine, but let's ensure it's properly formatted:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int64_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int64_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should now work correctly for all cases:
- Perfect numbers: 6, 28, etc.
- Abundant numbers: 12, 24, etc.
- Deficient numbers: 8, prime numbers, 1
- It throws an exception for numbers <= 0

This should now be ready to use. Let me know if there are any further issues.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to properly handle the classification. Let's carefully implement the solution.

The key is to find all proper divisors of the number (excluding the number itself) and sum them up to get the aliquot sum. Then compare this sum to the number to determine the classification.

However, there might be an issue with integer overflow or performance for large numbers, but since we're using std::int64_t, it should handle reasonably large numbers.

Wait, the implementation needs to find all divisors up to number-1, not just up to the square root. But actually, up to the square root is correct, as for every divisor found below the square root, there's a corresponding divisor above it.

But the implementation needs to be precise:
1. The aliquot sum should include all divisors except the number itself
2. So for number=1, the only divisor is 1, which we exclude, making the sum 0
3. This matches our earlier approach

Wait, but in the implementation, we start with aliquot_sum = 1, which is correct for numbers > 1, but for number=1, we handle it separately.

Let's fix the implementation to be more precise:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t aliquot_sum = 1;
    std::int64_t sqrt_number = static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number));
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= sqrt_number; ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            aliquot_sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                aliquot_sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (aliquot_sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (aliquot_sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle the case where number is 1 (no proper divisors except itself which we exclude)
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t aliquot_sum = 0;
    // Find all proper divisors
    for (std::int64_t i = 1; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            // Add the divisor
            aliquot_sum += i;
            // Add the corresponding divisor
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i && other_divisor != number) {
                aliquot_sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Compare the aliquot sum to the number
    if (aliquot_sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (aliquot_sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's an important fix needed: we need to make sure we're not including the number itself in the aliquot sum. The aliquot sum should only include proper divisors, which are all divisors except the number itself.

Wait, in the implementation above, we're adding divisors where other_divisor != number, which is correct. But we need to make sure that when i=1, we don't add number itself.

Let's test this implementation:
- For number=6: 
  i=1: 6%1==0 → add 1, other_divisor=6 → but other_divisor != i (1) → but other_divisor == number → don't add
  i=2: 6%2==0 → add 2, other_divisor=3 → add 3
  i up to ~2.4 → stop
  Sum: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 → perfect

- For number=1:
  Handled separately → deficient

- For number=28:
  Would work similarly

This seems correct. Let's also make sure to always use parentheses according to the rules:
1. (number % i) == 0 is correct
2. other_divisor != i && other_divisor != number
   According to the rules, we need to parenthesize each part:
   (other_divisor != i) && (other_divisor != number)

Wait, according to the rules, we need to parenthesize each relational test before combining with &&:
So let's fix that:

Wait, here's the fixed implementation:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if (other_divisor != i && other_divisor != number) {
=======
            if ((other_divisor != i) && (other_divisor != number)) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This ensures we follow the rule to parenthesize each relational test before combining them with &&.

This implementation should now correctly classify numbers according to Nicomachus' scheme:
1. Perfect: aliquot sum equals the number
2. Abundant: aliquot sum is greater than the number
3. Deficient: aliquot sum is less than the number

Let's hope this implementation passes all tests. If there are further issues, we may need to debug specific cases.
