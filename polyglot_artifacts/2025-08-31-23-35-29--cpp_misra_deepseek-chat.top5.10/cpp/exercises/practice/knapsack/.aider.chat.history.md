#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a fancy store.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value and weight.  
#### Bob would gladly take all of the items, but his knapsack can only hold so much weight.  
#### Bob has to carefully consider which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to determine which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized, taking into account the knapsack's carrying capacity.  
####   
#### Items will be represented as a list of items.  
#### Each item will have a weight and value.  
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10  
#### ```  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.cpp knapsack.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a solution to the classic 0/1 knapsack problem where we need to select items to maximize the total value without exceeding the maximum weight capacity. Since all values are positive, and we can only take each item once, this is a standard dynamic programming problem.

Since the maximum weight can be up to a certain limit, and the number of items can vary, we need an efficient approach. The dynamic programming approach where dp[i][w] represents the maximum value that can be obtained using the first i items with weight limit w is suitable.

However, to save space, we can use a 1D array approach.

Let's implement this. First, we need to add a function to the namespace that solves the knapsack problem. Since the instructions don't specify the exact function signature, I'll assume it should take a list of items and the maximum weight, and return the maximum value.

Wait, the instructions say to determine which items to take, but the example only shows the maximum value. Let's read carefully:
"Your task is to determine which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized"
But the example only shows the maximum value, not which items. So perhaps we need to return the maximum value.

However, the function signature isn't specified, so we need to add a function to the knapsack namespace.

Let's add a function that returns the maximum value.

Since we need to use fixed-width integer types, we'll include <cstdint> and use appropriate types.

Here are the necessary changes:

knapsack.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    int weight;
    int value;
};

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
=======
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <vector>

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    std::int32_t weight;
    std::int32_t value;
};

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items);

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the maximum_value function in knapsack.cpp:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"

namespace knapsack
{

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty() || maximum_weight == 0)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores the maximum value for weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The maximum value will be the maximum of all dp[w]
    // Since dp[w] is non-decreasing, it's at dp[maximum_weight]
    return dp[maximum_weight];
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation uses dynamic programming with a 1D array to find the maximum value that can be obtained without exceeding the maximum weight. It processes each item and updates the dp array from the maximum weight down to the item's weight to ensure each item is only considered once.

However, there are a few things to note:
1. All values are positive, so we can initialize dp with zeros
2. We need to process weights in reverse to avoid reusing the same item multiple times
3. The maximum value will be at dp[maximum_weight] at the end

This implementation should work efficiently within the constraints. Let's test it with the provided example:
Items: weight 5 value 10, weight 4 value 40, weight 6 value 30, weight 4 value 50
Maximum weight: 10

Processing:
- For item 1 (5,10): Update weights 10-5
- For item 2 (4,40): Update weights 10-4
- For item 3 (6,30): Update weights 10-6
- For item 4 (4,50): Update weights 10-4

The maximum value should be 90, which matches the example.

This implementation should work. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle cases where the maximum weight might be 0 or items might be empty. However, the implementation seems correct, but let's test it with the provided example.

Wait, the implementation always returns dp[maximum_weight], but sometimes the maximum value might be at a weight less than maximum_weight. But since all values are positive, and we're always trying to maximize value, and weights are non-negative, dp[w] should be non-decreasing. So dp[maximum_weight] should indeed be the maximum value.

However, to be precise, we should find the maximum value in the entire dp array, not just at maximum_weight, in case some items have weight 0 (though the problem says all weights are positive? The instructions say "All values given will be strictly positive" but it doesn't mention weights).

Since the problem says values are strictly positive, but weights could be zero? But if weight is zero, we can take those items for free, adding their value. So we need to make sure to include them.

Wait, the implementation doesn't handle items with weight 0 correctly because the inner loop condition is w >= item.weight, which for weight 0 would be always true, but we need to process them differently.

But the instructions don't specify that weights are positive, so we need to handle weight 0 items.

Let's fix this by processing items with weight 0 separately.

Wait, the implementation needs to be adjusted to always include items with weight 0:
For items with weight <= maximum_weight, which always includes weight 0
But the loop condition is w >= item.weight, which for weight 0 is w >= 0, which is always true
But we need to add their value to every dp[w]

But this would be incorrect because we're processing in reverse, and we might add the same item multiple times
Since it's 0/1 knapsack, we can only take each item once

So for items with weight 0, we can simply add their value to all dp entries
But to avoid reusing the same item, we need to process them differently

Actually, the implementation needs to be fixed to handle items with weight 0
Let's process items with weight 0 first, and then process others

Here's the revised implementation:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty() || maximum_weight == 0)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores the maximum value for weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The maximum value will be the maximum of all dp[w]
    // Since dp[w] is non-decreasing, it's at dp[maximum_weight]
    return dp[maximum_weight];
}

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    // Handle case when maximum_weight is 0 - we can only take items with weight 0
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        if (item.weight == 0)
        {
            // Add value to all dp entries since weight is 0
            for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximum_weight; ++w)
            {
                dp[w] += item.value;
            }
        }
        else
        {
            // Process in reverse to avoid reusing the same item
            for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w)
            {
                if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
                {
                    dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in dp array
    // Since all values are positive, and we can always take items with weight 0,
    // the maximum should be at the highest index, but to be safe, we'll find max
    std::int32_t max_value = 0;
    for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximum_weight; ++w)
    {
        if (dp[w] > max_value)
        {
            max_value = dp[w];
        }
    }
    return max_value;
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation properly handles items with weight 0 by adding their value to every entry in the dp array. For other items, it processes them in reverse to ensure each item is only used once. Finally, it finds the maximum value across all weights.

However, there's a potential issue: if there are multiple items with weight 0, their values are being added to every dp entry, which is correct because we can take all of them without affecting the weight. But we need to make sure we're not processing them multiple times in a way that would be incorrect.

This implementation should work for the provided example and handle edge cases. Let's test it with:
- Items with weight 0: their values should always be included
- Empty items list: returns 0
- Maximum weight 0: can only take items with weight 0

This seems correct. Let's proceed.
