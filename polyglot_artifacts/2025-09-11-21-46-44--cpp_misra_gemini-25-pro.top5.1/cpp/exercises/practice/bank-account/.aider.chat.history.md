#### # Introduction  
####   
#### After years of filling out forms and waiting, you've finally acquired your banking license.  
#### This means you are now officially eligible to open your own bank, hurray!  
####   
#### Your first priority is to get the IT systems up and running.  
#### After a day of hard work, you can already open and close accounts, as well as handle withdrawals and deposits.  
####   
#### Since you couldn't be bothered writing tests, you invite some friends to help test the system.  
#### However, after just five minutes, one of your friends claims they've lost money!  
#### While you're confident your code is bug-free, you start looking through the logs to investigate.  
####   
#### Ah yes, just as you suspected, your friend is at fault!  
#### They shared their test credentials with another friend, and together they conspired to make deposits and withdrawals from the same account _in parallel_.  
#### Who would do such a thing?  
####   
#### While you argue that it's physically _impossible_ for someone to access their account in parallel, your friend smugly notifies you that the banking rules _require_ you to support this.  
#### Thus, no parallel banking support, no go-live signal.  
#### Sighing, you create a mental note to work on this tomorrow.  
#### This will set your launch date back at _least_ one more day, but well...  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
####   
#### As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), your bank software must allow accounts to be safely accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.  
#### For example, there may be many deposits and withdrawals occurring in parallel; you need to ensure there are no [race conditions][wikipedia] between when you read the account balance and set the new balance.  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
####   
#### [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.h bank_account.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not use the keywords signed/unsigned char, short, int, long, or long long (and their unsigned forms) for variables, parameters, or return types.    
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types such as std::int8_t, std::uint16_t, std::int32_t, std::uint64_t, or project-specific typedefs/aliases that wrap them.    
#### - int is permitted only for the main() return type, its parameters (argc, argv), and as the dummy int in postfix ++/-- operators; avoid it elsewhere.    
#### - Typedef/using declarations that create aliases are allowed and encouraged for readability.    
#### - Plain char is covered by another rule; avoid it for integers.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Parenthesize every sub-expression that combines binary or ternary operators with different precedence levels ( *, /, %, +, -, <<, >>, <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, &, ^, |, &&, ||, ?: ).    
#### - Omit parentheses only when adjacent operators share the exact same precedence and associativity (e.g. `a + b - c`, `x & y ^ z`).    
#### - Unary operators may remain unparenthesized when used inside a larger expression (`a * -b` is OK).    
#### - Never rely on default precedence in conditions, assignments, returns, or initializers; make evaluation order explicit: `if ((a == 1) && (b > 0))`, `val = a * (b + 1);`.    
#### - Treat overloaded operators with the same caution; add parentheses for clarity even if the rule does not mandate it.    
#### - Example pitfalls: avoid `a * b + 1`, `if (a + b != c - d)`, `if (x == 0 && y > 1)`; rewrite with parentheses.  
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep numeric assignments strictly safe: identical type category, signedness and size, or an allowed widening/constant case    
#### - OK: same category & signedness, destination wider, source is a single variable (id-expression) ‒ e.g. `uint32_t big = small8;`    
#### - OK: floating-point constant → wider floating type ‒ e.g. `long double ld = 1.0f;`    
#### - OK: integer constant/constant expression → any numeric type (or bit-field) whose range can hold the value ‒ e.g. `float f = 42;`, `uint8_t u = 255;`    
#### - Otherwise: do NOT assign, initialise, pass by value, return, or use in a `case` label    
####   • No wider→narrower size (e.g. `uint8_t u = uint32_t_val;`)    
####   • No signed↔unsigned change (e.g. `uint32_t = int32_t;`)    
####   • No integer↔floating conversion except the constant cases above    
####   • No value that exceeds target range    
#### - For widening, use a variable, not an arithmetic expression; if you must convert, use an explicit cast that yields a compliant source type first    
#### - Apply the same checks in constructors, default arguments, lambda captures, operator calls, etc. ‒ every by-value transfer counts as an assignment    
#### - Treat unscoped enums as their underlying integral type when checking these rules  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Never convert character types (‘char’, ‘signed/unsigned char’, ‘wchar_t’, ‘char16_t’, ‘char32_t’) to or from any non-character arithmetic type (int, bool, enum, float, …); forbid both implicit assignments and casts.    
#### - Do not perform arithmetic, bitwise, relational (<, >, <=, >=), or ++/-- on character objects; only == and != between identical character types are allowed.    
#### - Initialise/assign character variables exclusively with character literals of the same category (e.g., char c = '\n'; wchar_t w = L'x';), not numeric constants.    
#### - When an integer representation is unavoidable, use library helpers such as std::char_traits<CharT>::to_int_type(), never rely on direct conversion.    
#### - Use <cctype>/<cwctype> utilities (std::isalpha, std::tolower, …) instead of numeric range checks on characters.    
#### - Raw byte or small-integer data should be held in std::byte, std::uint8_t, or int8_t, not in char-family types.    
#### - Unevaluated operands (sizeof, decltype, alignof) and casts to void of a function call returning a character are permissible.  
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always wrap the body of every `if` in `{ … }`, even if it is a single statement    
#### - Always wrap the body of every `else` in `{ … }`; braces may be omitted only when the `else` is immediately followed by another `if` (`else if`)    
#### - Do not place any non-braced statement directly after `if (…)` or `else`    
#### - Never write `if (condition);` — replace with a braced empty block or remove the statement    
#### - Keep braces and indentation consistent so the controlled block is visually unambiguous  
####   
#### The numeric value of an unscoped enumeration with no fixed underlying type shall not be used  
#### - Declare enums as `enum class` or give them an explicit underlying type (e.g. `enum Mode : std::uint8_t`); avoid plain `enum Mode { … };`.  
#### - For an unscoped enum without a fixed underlying type:  
####   • Do NOT use it with any arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or compound-assignment operator.    
####   • Only compare it (`==, !=, <, >, <=, >=`) with another value of the same enum type.    
####   • In `switch (e)`, every `case` label must be an enumerator of that same enum.    
####   • Only assign/initialize/return/pass it to the same enum type; if an integral value is required, first cast to an integer type wide enough to hold every enumerator.    
####   • `static_cast` is permitted only to a sufficiently wide integer type; never cast to another enum or to a too-narrow integer.    
#### - If you need numeric manipulation, either cast the value to a wide integer first or redesign the enum as `enum class` / fixed-width to remove the restriction.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

Based on your instructions, I will implement a thread-safe bank account. Here are the changes I'll make:

1.  In `bank_account.h`, I will define the `Bankaccount` class. It will include public methods for construction, closing, depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance. Private members will store the account's state (open/closed), balance, and a mutex for thread synchronization.
2.  In `bank_account.cpp`, I will implement the methods declared in the header. Each method will use `std::lock_guard` to ensure thread safety. Operations will check if the account is open and validate inputs, throwing a `std::runtime_error` if an operation cannot be completed.

Here are the required changes:

```cpp
bank_account.h
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <mutex>

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {
 public:
  Bankaccount();

  void close();
  void deposit(std::int64_t amount);
  void withdraw(std::int64_t amount);
  std::int64_t balance() const;

 private:
  bool open_{true};
  std::int64_t account_balance_{0};
  mutable std::mutex mutex_{};
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```cpp

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() {}

void Bankaccount::close() {
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
  open_ = false;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
  if (!open_) {
    throw std::runtime_error("account is closed");
  }
  if (amount < 0) {
    throw std::runtime_error("cannot deposit negative amount");
  }
  account_balance_ += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
  if (!open_) {
    throw std::runtime_error("account is closed");
  }
  if (amount < 0) {
    throw std::runtime_error("cannot withdraw negative amount");
  }
  if (account_balance_ < amount) {
    throw std::runtime_error("insufficient funds");
  }
  account_balance_ -= amount;
}

std::int64_t Bankaccount::balance() const {
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
  if (!open_) {
    throw std::runtime_error("account is closed");
  }
  return account_balance_;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount

I've analyzed the code and found a potential error that could lead to "losing money" as described in the scenario. The `deposit` function does not check for integer overflow. If a large amount is deposited into an account that already has a high balance, the balance could wrap around to a large negative number.

To fix this, I will:

1.  Include the `<limits>` header in `bank_account.cpp` to get the maximum value for `std::int64_t`.
2.  Add a check in the `deposit` function to throw an exception if the deposit would cause an overflow. I'll also add parentheses to comply with the MISRA rule about operator precedence.

Here are the changes:

```cpp
bank_account.cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "bank_account.h"

#include <stdexcept>
=======
#include "bank_account.h"

#include <limits>
#include <stdexcept>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```cpp
bank_account.cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  if (amount < 0) {
    throw std::runtime_error("cannot deposit negative amount");
  }
  account_balance_ += amount;
}
=======
  if (amount < 0) {
    throw std::runtime_error("cannot deposit negative amount");
  }
  if (account_balance_ > (std::numeric_limits<std::int64_t>::max() - amount)) {
    throw std::runtime_error("deposit would cause overflow");
  }
  account_balance_ += amount;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in bank_account.h bank_account.cpp to resolve the errors.  

Based on the compiler errors, the test suite expects a public method `open()` in the `Bankaccount` class, which is currently missing. The tests also appear to expect that an account is created in a "closed" state and must be explicitly opened before use. Calling `open()` on an already-open account should result in an error.

To fix this, I will make the following changes:
1.  In `bank_account.h`, I will add the declaration for a new public method `void open();`.
2.  I will change the default state of an account to be closed by modifying the initializer for `open_` from `true` to `false` in `bank_account.h`.
3.  In `bank_account.cpp`, I will implement the `open()` method. This method will set the account state to open and reset the balance to zero. It will also be thread-safe and throw a `std::runtime_error` if the account is already open, as the tests seem to require.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks to apply these changes:

  }
  open_ = true;

}

I've analyzed the code and found a potential logic error.

All methods that interact with an account's state (`open`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, `balance`) first verify that the account is in a valid state for that operation. However, the `close` method does not check if the account is already closed. For consistency and robustness, I will modify `close` to throw a `std::runtime_error` if it is called on an account that is not open.

Here is the required change:

```cpp
bank_account.cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
void Bankaccount::close() {
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
  open_ = false;
}
=======
void Bankaccount::close() {
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
  if (!open_) {
    throw std::runtime_error("account is closed");
  }
  open_ = false;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
