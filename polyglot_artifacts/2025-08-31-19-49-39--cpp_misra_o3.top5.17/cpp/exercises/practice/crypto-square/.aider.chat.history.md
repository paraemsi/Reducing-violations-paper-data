#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement the classic method for composing secret messages called a square code.  
####   
#### Given an English text, output the encoded version of that text.  
####   
#### First, the input is normalized: the spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the message is down-cased.  
####   
#### Then, the normalized characters are broken into rows.  
#### These rows can be regarded as forming a rectangle when printed with intervening newlines.  
####   
#### For example, the sentence  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "If man was meant to stay on the ground, god would have given us roots."  
#### ```  
####   
#### is normalized to:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "ifmanwasmeanttostayonthegroundgodwouldhavegivenusroots"  
#### ```  
####   
#### The plaintext should be organized into a rectangle as square as possible.  
#### The size of the rectangle should be decided by the length of the message.  
####   
#### If `c` is the number of columns and `r` is the number of rows, then for the rectangle `r` x `c` find the smallest possible integer `c` such that:  
####   
#### - `r * c >= length of message`,  
#### - and `c >= r`,  
#### - and `c - r <= 1`.  
####   
#### Our normalized text is 54 characters long, dictating a rectangle with `c = 8` and `r = 7`:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "ifmanwas"  
#### "meanttos"  
#### "tayonthe"  
#### "groundgo"  
#### "dwouldha"  
#### "vegivenu"  
#### "sroots  "  
#### ```  
####   
#### The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right.  
####   
#### The message above is coded as:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvsfearwermayoogoanouuiontnnlvtwttddesaohghnsseoau"  
#### ```  
####   
#### Output the encoded text in chunks that fill perfect rectangles `(r X c)`, with `c` chunks of `r` length, separated by spaces.  
#### For phrases that are `n` characters short of the perfect rectangle, pad each of the last `n` chunks with a single trailing space.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn  sseoau "  
#### ```  
####   
#### Notice that were we to stack these, we could visually decode the ciphertext back in to the original message:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvs"  
#### "fearwer"  
#### "mayoogo"  
#### "anouuio"  
#### "ntnnlvt"  
#### "wttddes"  
#### "aohghn "  
#### "sseoau "  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: crypto_square.h crypto_square.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>
