#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.  
####   
#### `a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.  
#### The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.  
#### The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.  
####   
#### The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:  
#### `(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,  
#### `(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.  
####   
#### Multiplication result is by definition  
#### `(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.  
####   
#### The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is  
#### `1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:  
#### `(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Raising e to a complex exponent can be expressed as `e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`, the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,  
#### - conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.  
####   
#### Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: complex_numbers.cpp complex_numbers.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not use the keywords signed/unsigned char, short, int, long, or long long (and their unsigned forms) for variables, parameters, or return types.    
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types such as std::int8_t, std::uint16_t, std::int32_t, std::uint64_t, or project-specific typedefs/aliases that wrap them.    
#### - int is permitted only for the main() return type, its parameters (argc, argv), and as the dummy int in postfix ++/-- operators; avoid it elsewhere.    
#### - Typedef/using declarations that create aliases are allowed and encouraged for readability.    
#### - Plain char is covered by another rule; avoid it for integers.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Parenthesize every sub-expression that combines binary or ternary operators with different precedence levels ( *, /, %, +, -, <<, >>, <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, &, ^, |, &&, ||, ?: ).    
#### - Omit parentheses only when adjacent operators share the exact same precedence and associativity (e.g. `a + b - c`, `x & y ^ z`).    
#### - Unary operators may remain unparenthesized when used inside a larger expression (`a * -b` is OK).    
#### - Never rely on default precedence in conditions, assignments, returns, or initializers; make evaluation order explicit: `if ((a == 1) && (b > 0))`, `val = a * (b + 1);`.    
#### - Treat overloaded operators with the same caution; add parentheses for clarity even if the rule does not mandate it.    
#### - Example pitfalls: avoid `a * b + 1`, `if (a + b != c - d)`, `if (x == 0 && y > 1)`; rewrite with parentheses.  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Never convert character types (‘char’, ‘signed/unsigned char’, ‘wchar_t’, ‘char16_t’, ‘char32_t’) to or from any non-character arithmetic type (int, bool, enum, float, …); forbid both implicit assignments and casts.    
#### - Do not perform arithmetic, bitwise, relational (<, >, <=, >=), or ++/-- on character objects; only == and != between identical character types are allowed.    
#### - Initialise/assign character variables exclusively with character literals of the same category (e.g., char c = '\n'; wchar_t w = L'x';), not numeric constants.    
#### - When an integer representation is unavoidable, use library helpers such as std::char_traits<CharT>::to_int_type(), never rely on direct conversion.    
#### - Use <cctype>/<cwctype> utilities (std::isalpha, std::tolower, …) instead of numeric range checks on characters.    
#### - Raw byte or small-integer data should be held in std::byte, std::uint8_t, or int8_t, not in char-family types.    
#### - Unevaluated operands (sizeof, decltype, alignof) and casts to void of a function call returning a character are permissible.  
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep numeric assignments strictly safe: identical type category, signedness and size, or an allowed widening/constant case    
#### - OK: same category & signedness, destination wider, source is a single variable (id-expression) ‒ e.g. `uint32_t big = small8;`    
#### - OK: floating-point constant → wider floating type ‒ e.g. `long double ld = 1.0f;`    
#### - OK: integer constant/constant expression → any numeric type (or bit-field) whose range can hold the value ‒ e.g. `float f = 42;`, `uint8_t u = 255;`    
#### - Otherwise: do NOT assign, initialise, pass by value, return, or use in a `case` label    
####   • No wider→narrower size (e.g. `uint8_t u = uint32_t_val;`)    
####   • No signed↔unsigned change (e.g. `uint32_t = int32_t;`)    
####   • No integer↔floating conversion except the constant cases above    
####   • No value that exceeds target range    
#### - For widening, use a variable, not an arithmetic expression; if you must convert, use an explicit cast that yields a compliant source type first    
#### - Apply the same checks in constructors, default arguments, lambda captures, operator calls, etc. ‒ every by-value transfer counts as an assignment    
#### - Treat unscoped enums as their underlying integral type when checking these rules  
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always wrap the body of every `if` in `{ … }`, even if it is a single statement    
#### - Always wrap the body of every `else` in `{ … }`; braces may be omitted only when the `else` is immediately followed by another `if` (`else if`)    
#### - Do not place any non-braced statement directly after `if (…)` or `else`    
#### - Never write `if (condition);` — replace with a braced empty block or remove the statement    
#### - Keep braces and indentation consistent so the controlled block is visually unambiguous  
#### </rules>

I'll implement a Complex class with all the required operations following the MISRA C++ rules provided.

## Changes needed:

1. **Header file (complex_numbers.h)**: Define a Complex class with:
   - Constructor for real and imaginary parts
   - Methods for arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
   - Methods for conjugate, absolute value, and exponential
   - Private members for real and imaginary parts

2. **Implementation file (complex_numbers.cpp)**: Implement all the methods with the mathematical formulas provided, following MISRA C++ rules for type safety and proper parenthesization.

Looking at the marked lines, I can see that the issue is with the parameter names in the constructor. The parameters `real` and `imaginary` conflict with the method names `real()` and `imag()`. This can cause naming conflicts in some contexts. I'll fix this by renaming the constructor parameters.

Looking at the marked lines, it appears there might be an issue with the method signatures or naming. The most likely issue is that the methods `real()` and `imag()` might be conflicting with standard library names or there could be a missing default constructor. Let me add a default constructor and ensure the implementation is complete.

complex_numbers.h

Looking at the marked lines, I see that the issue is likely that the existing code uses `double` types, but the MISRA C++ rules require avoiding primitive types. However, for floating-point numbers, `double` is actually acceptable in MISRA C++ (the rule about avoiding standard types applies to integer types, not floating-point). 

The actual issue might be that there's an existing different interface expected. Let me check if perhaps the class needs to match a specific existing interface. Given that the instruction says "Don't change the names of existing functions or classes", I should check if the expected interface might be different.

Let me provide a version that keeps the same functionality but ensures all MISRA rules are properly followed:

#### See the testing errors above.

#### Fix the code in complex_numbers.cpp complex_numbers.h to resolve the errors.  

Looking at the test errors, I need to add support for operations between Complex numbers and doubles (scalar values). The tests expect to be able to:
- Add a double to a Complex (both `c + 5.0` and `5.0 + c`)
- Subtract a double from a Complex (both `c - 4.0` and `4.0 - c`)
- Multiply a Complex by a double (both `c * 5.0` and `5.0 * c`)
- Divide a Complex by a double (both `c / 10.0` and `5.0 / c`)

I'll add these operator overloads to support mixed operations with doubles.

Looking at the marked lines, it seems like there might be an issue with the use of `double` types in the context of MISRA C++ rules. However, the MISRA rules provided specifically mention that the restriction on primitive types applies to integer types, not floating-point types. The `double` type is acceptable for floating-point operations.

The marked lines don't show actual errors, but rather seem to be highlighting the interface. Let me check if there's a potential issue with the constructor having a parameter named `real_value` when there's also a method named `real()`. However, this shouldn't cause compilation errors.

Since the marked lines don't indicate specific compilation errors, and the code structure looks correct, I'll ensure the files are complete and properly formatted:
