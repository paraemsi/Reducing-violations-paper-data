#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The kindergarten class is learning about growing plants.  
#### The teacher thought it would be a good idea to give the class seeds to plant and grow in the dirt.  
#### To this end, the children have put little cups along the window sills and planted one type of plant in each cup.  
#### The children got to pick their favorites from four available types of seeds: grass, clover, radishes, and violets.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to, given a diagram, determine which plants each child in the kindergarten class is responsible for.  
####   
#### There are 12 children in the class:  
####   
#### - Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve, Fred, Ginny, Harriet, Ileana, Joseph, Kincaid, and Larry.  
####   
#### Four different types of seeds are planted:  
####   
#### | Plant  | Diagram encoding |  
#### | ------ | ---------------- |  
#### | Grass  | G                |  
#### | Clover | C                |  
#### | Radish | R                |  
#### | Violet | V                |  
####   
#### Each child gets four cups, two on each row:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### ........................ # each dot represents a cup  
#### ........................  
#### ```  
####   
#### Their teacher assigns cups to the children alphabetically by their names, which means that Alice comes first and Larry comes last.  
####   
#### Here is an example diagram representing Alice's plants:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VR......................  
#### RG......................  
#### ```  
####   
#### In the first row, nearest the windows, she has a violet and a radish.  
#### In the second row she has a radish and some grass.  
####   
#### Your program will be given the plants from left-to-right starting with the row nearest the windows.  
#### From this, it should be able to determine which plants belong to each student.  
####   
#### For example, if it's told that the garden looks like so:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV  
#### VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then if asked for Alice's plants, it should provide:  
####   
#### - Violets, radishes, violets, radishes  
####   
#### While asking for Bob's plants would yield:  
####   
#### - Clover, grass, clover, clover  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: kindergarten_garden.cpp kindergarten_garden.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a function that, given a diagram of plants, can determine which plants belong to each child. The children are always in a fixed order, and each child gets two plants from each row, making four plants total per child.

Since the diagram is provided as a string, we need to split it into two rows and then assign each pair of plants in each row to each child in order.

Let's think about the implementation:
1. Split the input into two lines
2. For each child, take two plants from the first row and two from the second row
3. The plants are assigned in order to the children in alphabetical order

Since there are always 12 children, and each gets 2 plants per row, each row should have 24 plants (12 children * 2 plants each)

However, the example shows:
"VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV"
"VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV"

These are 24 characters each, which matches.

Let's implement a function that takes a diagram and a child's name, and returns their plants.
But the instructions aren't clear about the function signature, so we need to be careful.

Wait, the files provided are empty, so we need to define the interface.
Since it's a header file, we need to declare a function.

Let's define plants() which takes a diagram and a child's name, and returns a list of plants.

However, the instructions don't specify the exact signature, so we need to make assumptions.
Since it's C++, we can use std::vector.

Here's the plan:
1. Split the diagram into two rows
2. Find the index of the child in the ordered list of children
3. For each row, take two plants at the index*2 position
4. Convert the characters to plant names

Let's implement:

Here are the necessary changes:

kindergarten_garden.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#pragma once

namespace kindergarten_garden {

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
=======
#pragma once
#include <vector>
#include <string>

namespace kindergarten_garden {

std::vector<std::string> plants(const std::string& diagram, const std::string& student);

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation:

kindergarten_garden.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "kindergarten_garden.h"

namespace kindergarten_garden {

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
=======
#include "kindergarten_garden.h"
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <array>

namespace kindergarten_garden {

std::vector<std::string> plants(const std::string& diagram, const std::string& student) {
    // List of children in order
    const std::array<std::string, 12> children = {
        "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve", "Fred",
        "Ginny", "Harriet", "Ileana", "Joseph", "Kincaid", "Larry"
    };
    
    // Find the index of the student
    int index = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
        if (children[i] == student) {
            index = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // Split the diagram into two rows
    std::istringstream iss(diagram);
    std::string row1, row2;
    std::getline(iss, row1);
    std::getline(iss, row2);
    
    // Get the plants for the child
    std::vector<std::string> result;
    
    // For each plant code, convert to full name
    for (int i = 2 * index; i < 2 * index + 2; i++) {
        switch (row1[i]) {
            case 'G': result.emplace_back("grass"); break;
            case 'C': result.emplace_back("clover"); break;
            case 'R': result.emplace_back("radishes"); break;
            case 'V': result.emplace_back("violets"); break;
        }
    }
    for (int i = 2 * index; i < 2 * index + 2; i++) {
        switch (row2[i]) {
            case 'G': result.emplace_back("grass"); break;
            case 'C': result.emplace_back("clover"); break;
            case 'R': result.emplace_back("radishes"); break;
            case 'V': result.emplace_back("violets"); break;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The diagram may be provided with newlines, which we split using string stream
2. We need to find the index of the child in the ordered list
3. Each child gets two plants from the first row and two from the second row, at positions index*2 and index*2 +1

This implementation should work for the examples:
- Alice is first, so index=0: plants from positions 0 and 1 in both rows
- Bob is second, so index=1: plants from positions 2 and 3 in both rows

Wait, the example says:
Alice: Violets, radishes, violets, radishes
Which matches:
First row: 'V' at 0, 'R' at 1
Second row: 'V' at 0, 'R' at 1? Wait, but the implementation uses the same index for both rows, which may not be correct.

Actually, the implementation always uses the same index for both rows, which seems to match:
VR...................... (first row)
RG...................... (second row)
Alice's plants: V, R from first row, R, G from second row
But the example says: violet, radish, radish, grass
Which matches: V, R, R, G

Wait, the implementation always takes two from first row, then two from second row
So it's correct.

This implementation should work. Let's proceed.

I notice that the implementation uses `int` which violates the MISRA C++ rules. Let's fix that by using appropriate types. Also, we need to include the necessary headers and ensure all types are correct.

Here are the necessary fixes:

1. Add missing includes
2. Use std::size_t instead of int
3. Make sure all types are appropriate

Here are the changes:

kindergarten_garden.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#pragma once
#include <vector>
#include <string>

namespace kindergarten_garden {

std::vector<std::string> plants(const std::string& diagram, const std::string& student);

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden

#include <vector>
#include <string>

namespace kindergarten_garden {

std::vector<std::string> plants(const std::string& diagram, const std::string& student);

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Wait, the header file is fine, but we need to fix the implementation:

kindergarten_garden.cpp

```

Key changes made:
1. Added #include <cstddef> for std::size_t
2. Changed all int types to std::size_t
3. Used children.size() instead of hard-coded 12
4. Added default cases to switch statements
5. Used const for start_pos and end_pos to avoid repeated calculations
6. Removed the index = -1 initialization since std::size_t is unsigned

This implementation should now comply with the MISRA C++ rules while maintaining the same functionality.

I notice that the implementation may not be handling the diagram splitting correctly. The diagram is provided as a single string that may contain newline characters. Let's make sure we split it properly.

However, the implementation seems to use a string stream which should work. Let's test the implementation with the provided example:
Diagram:
"VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV\nVRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV"

But the implementation uses std::getline which should split on newlines correctly.

Wait, the implementation may have an issue if the diagram doesn't end with a newline, but the example shows two separate lines.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Let's run through the example:
Alice's plants should be at index 0, so positions 0-1 in both rows:
Row 1: 'V' 'R' -> Violets, Radishes
Row 2: 'V' 'R' -> Violets, Radishes
But the example says: Violets, radishes, violets, radishes
Wait, the second row starts with 'VR' which matches 'V' 'R' -> Violets, Radishes
So it matches: Violets, Radishes, Violets, Radishes

Wait, but the implementation uses:
First row: 'VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV' -> 'V' at 0, 'R' at 1
Second row: 'VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV' -> 'V' at 0, 'R' at 1
Which matches

Wait, but the implementation seems correct. Maybe the issue is that the header needs to include the necessary headers.

Wait, the header includes <vector> and <string>, which should be sufficient.

Let's make sure all includes are present and the implementation is correct.

Wait, the implementation uses std::istringstream but doesn't include <sstream>
But the file shows it's included.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Let's see if there are any other issues.

Wait, the implementation may have an issue if the diagram is provided without a newline, but according to the instructions, it should always have two rows.

Let's proceed with the implementation as is, but add a check to ensure we always have two rows.

Wait, the implementation seems to be correct. Let's run it through a test.

However, to be thorough, let's add some error handling:

Wait, the implementation needs to be robust. Let's make sure we always have exactly two lines:

Here's an improved implementation:

I understand. The tests expect an enum type `Plants` to be used, but our implementation returns `std::vector<std::string>`. Let's fix that by defining the `Plants` enum and using it.

Here are the necessary changes:

kindergarten_garden.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#pragma once
#include <vector>
#include <string>

namespace kindergarten_garden {

std::vector<std::string> plants(const std::string& diagram, const std::string& student);

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
=======
#pragma once
#include <vector>
#include <string>

namespace kindergarten_garden {

enum class Plants {
    grass,
    clover,
    radishes,
    violets
};

std::vector<Plants> plants(const std::string& diagram, const std::string& student);

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's update the implementation to return `std::vector<Plants>`:

kindergarten_garden.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "kindergarten_garden.h"
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <array>

    // List of children in order
    const std::array<std::string, 12> children = {
        "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve", "Fred",
        "Ginny", "Harriet", "Ileana", "Joseph", "Kincaid", "Larry"
    };
    
    // Find the index of the student
    std::size_t index = 0;
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < children.size(); i++) {
        if (children[i] == student) {
            index = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    std::getline(iss, row2);
    
    // Ensure we have valid rows
    // Each row should have exactly 24 characters
    // But according to the instructions, each child has 2 plants per row, and there are 12 children
    // So 12 * 2 = 24
    
    // Get the plants for the child
    std::vector<std::string> result;
    
    // For each plant code, convert to full name
    // Calculate start index
    const std::size_t start_pos = 2 * index;
    
    // Process first row
    for (std::size_t i = start_pos; i < (start_pos + 2); i++) {
        switch (row1[i]) {
            case 'G': result.push_back("grass"); break;
            case 'C': result.push_back("clover"); break;

            default: break;

```

This implementation now uses the `Plants` enum as expected by the tests. The logic remains the same, but we're now returning `std::vector<Plants>` instead of `std::vector<std::string>`. This should resolve the compilation errors.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle the diagram correctly. The diagram is provided as a single string that may contain newlines, and we need to split it into two rows properly. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

    // List of children in order
    const std::array<std::string, 12> children = {
        "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve", "Fred",
        "Ginny", "Harriet", "Ileana", "Joseph", "Kincaid", "Larry"
    };
    
    // Find the index of the student

```

This implementation now properly handles splitting the diagram into two rows by reading each line from the string stream. This should work for cases where the diagram is provided with newline characters separating the two rows. 

However, if the diagram is provided as a single string without newlines, this implementation may not work correctly. But according to the instructions, the diagram is given with two rows, so it should be fine. Let's hope this resolves any issues.
