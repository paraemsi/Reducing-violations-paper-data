#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of [perfect](#perfect), [abundant](#abundant), or [deficient](#deficient) based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The _aliquot sum_ is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of `15` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.  
####   
#### ## Perfect  
####   
#### A number is perfect when it equals its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `6` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`  
#### - `28` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`  
####   
#### ## Abundant  
####   
#### A number is abundant when it is less than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `12` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
#### - `24` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36`  
####   
#### ## Deficient  
####   
#### A number is deficient when it is greater than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `8` is a deficient number because `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`  
#### - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is [perfect](#perfect).  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is [abundant](#abundant) or [deficient](#deficient).

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: perfect_numbers.h perfect_numbers.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. We need to implement a classification for numbers based on their aliquot sum. Let's think through this carefully.

Since we need to determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient, we'll need a function that can classify a number into one of these categories. Let's add an enum to represent these classifications and a function to compute the classification.

However, the instructions mention that depending on the language track, we may need to implement all three classifications. Since we're working with C++, it's better to be thorough and implement all three.

First, let's update the header file to declare the enum and the classification function.

Here are the necessary changes:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int64_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the classify function in the .cpp file. We need to calculate the aliquot sum and compare it to the number to determine the classification.

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Classification is only for positive integers");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case (its only proper divisor is 0)
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t aliquot_sum = 1; // 1 is always a divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            aliquot_sum += i;
            // Add the complementary divisor if it's different
            std::int64_t complement = number / i;
            if (complement != i) {
                aliquot_sum += complement;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (aliquot_sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (aliquot_sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to include <stdexcept> for std::domain_error
2. We need to handle numbers <= 0 by throwing an exception
3. We need to be efficient in finding divisors by only going up to the square root
4. We need to add both the divisor and its complement when they're different
5. We need to handle 1 as a special case since its only proper divisor is none (but 1 is always a divisor of every number, but the aliquot sum should be 0? Wait, the aliquot sum is the sum of proper divisors which are less than the number)
   So for number=1, proper divisors are none, so aliquot sum is 0 which is less than 1 → deficient

Wait, but in the implementation, we started with 1, which is always a proper divisor for numbers > 1
But for number=1, we need to handle it separately, which we do

This implementation should work correctly:
- For number=6: divisors are 1, 2, 3 → sum=6 → perfect
- For number=28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 → sum=28 → perfect
- For number=12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → sum=16 > 12 → abundant
- For number=8: 1, 2, 4 → sum=7 < 8 → deficient
- For primes: only divisor is 1 → sum=1 < number → deficient

This matches the examples provided. Let's proceed with this implementation.

I understand. The issue is that the `classify` function needs to be declared in a way that's compatible with the test cases. Since the tests might be expecting a specific signature, and the implementation needs to follow certain rules, let's make sure everything is correct.

However, the implementation needs to be adjusted to handle the aliquot sum correctly. The aliquot sum should only include proper divisors, which are divisors less than the number itself. So for number=1, the aliquot sum is 0, which is correct.

Wait, the implementation starts with 1, which is always a proper divisor for numbers greater than 1, but for number=1, we handle it separately. That seems correct.

However, there's a potential issue: the implementation may include the number itself if it's a perfect square? No, because i starts from 2 and goes up to sqrt(number), and number is always greater than i, so number/i will always be at least 2, which is greater than or equal to i, and always less than number when i > 1.

Wait, when i=1, we've already added 1, which is correct.
But when number is a perfect square, we need to make sure we don't add the square root twice, which we handle with the condition `if (complement != i)`.

This seems correct.

However, the implementation needs to follow the MISRA C++ rules provided:
1. Use fixed-width integer types
2. Parenthesize expressions properly
3. Use compound statements for if/else
4. No numerical values of characters
5. Appropriate assignments between numeric types

Let's fix the implementation to follow these rules:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Classification is only for positive integers");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case (its only proper divisor is 0)
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t aliquot_sum = 1; // 1 is always a divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            aliquot_sum += i;
            // Add the complementary divisor if it's different
            std::int64_t complement = number / i;
            if (complement != i) {
                aliquot_sum += complement;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (aliquot_sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (aliquot_sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Classification is only for positive integers");
    }
    
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t aliquot_sum = 1;
    std::int64_t sqrt_number = static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number));
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= sqrt_number; ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            aliquot_sum += i;
            std::int64_t complement = number / i;
            if (complement != i) {
                aliquot_sum += complement;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (aliquot_sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else {
        if (aliquot_sum > number) {
            return classification::abundant;
        } else {
            return classification::deficient;
        }
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation follows the rules:
1. All if/else statements use compound statements with braces
2. We use fixed-width integer types
3. We parenthesize expressions where necessary
4. No numerical values of characters are used
5. All assignments are between compatible types

However, there's a potential issue: when number is very large, the square root might be a floating point number that doesn't convert perfectly to an integer. But since we're dealing with integers, and using static_cast to int64_t, it should floor the value which is correct for our purposes.

This implementation should now work correctly for all cases:
- Perfect numbers: aliquot sum equals the number
- Abundant numbers: aliquot sum is greater than the number
- Deficient numbers: aliquot sum is less than the number

Let's test the cases:
- 6: divisors are 1, 2, 3 → sum=6 → perfect
- 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 → sum=28 → perfect
- 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → sum=16 > 12 → abundant
- 8: 1, 2, 4 → sum=7 < 8 → deficient
- 1: no loop, handled directly → sum=0 < 1 → deficient

This matches the requirements.
