#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a clock that handles times without dates.  
####   
#### You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.  
####   
#### Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.cpp clock.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a clock class that can handle times without dates, support adding and subtracting minutes, and ensure that two clocks representing the same time are considered equal. Let's think through this implementation.

Since we're dealing with times, we need to handle hours and minutes, and ensure that adding or subtracting minutes correctly wraps around when crossing day boundaries (24 hours).

Let's implement a Clock class that stores minutes since midnight (0-1439). This makes it easy to add and subtract minutes while always keeping the time valid by using modulo 1440 (24*60) operations.

However, the instructions mention to not change existing function or class names, but the provided files are empty. So we need to define a Clock class within the date_independent namespace.

Wait, the tests probably expect certain interfaces. Let's implement:
1. A constructor that takes hours and minutes
2. A way to add and subtract minutes
3. Equality comparison
4. A toString() method to represent the time in "HH:MM" format

Since we need to use fixed-width integer types, we'll include <cstdint> and use appropriate types.

Here's the implementation:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
=======
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

namespace date_independent {
    class clock {
    private:
        std::int32_t minutes_since_midnight;
        clock(std::int32_t minutes);
    public:
        static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
        clock plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const;
        clock minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const;
        operator std::string() const;
        bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
        bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;
    };
}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in clock.cpp:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {
    clock::clock(std::int32_t minutes) : minutes_since_midnight(minutes) {}
    
    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        // Convert everything to minutes and normalize to be within 0-1439
        std::int32_t total_minutes = ((hours * 60) + minutes) % 1440;
        if (total_minutes < 0) {
            total_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(total_minutes);
    }
    
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const {
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (minutes_since_midnight + minutes_to_add) % 1440;
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const {
        // Adding negative minutes is the same as subtracting
        return this->plus(-minutes_to_subtract);
    }
    
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = (minutes_since_midnight / 60) % 24;
        std::int32_t minutes = minutes_since_midnight % 60;
        
        // Ensure hours and minutes are non-negative (they always should be)
        if (hours < 0) {
            hours += 24;
        }
        if (minutes < 0) {
            minutes += 60;
        }
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << minutes;
        return oss.str();
    }
    
    bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
        return (minutes_since_midnight == other.minutes_since_midnight);
    }
    
    bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
        return !(*this == other);
    }
}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The plus and minus operations need to handle wrapping around correctly
2. We always normalize the time to be within 0-1439 minutes
3. The toString() implementation uses stringstream to format the time properly
4. We've added operator== and operator!= for comparison

This implementation should handle:
- Adding and subtracting minutes, which can be positive or negative
- Wrapping around midnight boundaries
- Proper formatting of the time
- Equality comparison based on the internal minutes since midnight

Since the tests may expect certain interfaces, and we're not changing existing function names, this implementation should work. Let's hope the tests use the clock class through the provided interface.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle the conversion from hours and minutes to total minutes correctly, especially when dealing with negative values. Let's fix that.

The key is to always normalize the total minutes to be within 0-1439 (inclusive) to represent a valid time of day. This can be done using modulo arithmetic.

However, the modulo operation in C++ for negative numbers doesn't always produce positive results, so we need to adjust for that.

Here are the necessary fixes:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        // Convert everything to minutes and normalize to be within 0-1439
        std::int32_t total_minutes = ((hours * 60) + minutes) % 1440;
        if (total_minutes < 0) {
            total_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(total_minutes);
    }
    
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const {
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (minutes_since_midnight + minutes_to_add) % 1440;
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const {
        // Adding negative minutes is the same as subtracting
        return this->plus(-minutes_to_subtract);
    }
    
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = (minutes_since_midnight / 60) % 24;
        std::int32_t minutes = minutes_since_midnight % 60;
        
        // Ensure hours and minutes are non-negative (they always should be)
        if (hours < 0) {
            hours += 24;
        }
        if (minutes < 0) {
            minutes += 60;
        }
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << minutes;
        return oss.str();
    }
=======
    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        // First, convert everything to total minutes
        std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        // Normalize to be within 0-1439
        total_minutes %= 1440;
        if (total_minutes < 0) {
            total_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(total_minutes);
    }
    
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const {
        // Add minutes and normalize
        return clock::at(0, minutes_since_midnight + minutes_to_add);
    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const {
        // Subtract minutes by adding negative value
        return this->plus(-minutes_to_subtract);
    }
    
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        // Calculate hours and minutes
        std::int32_t hours = minutes_since_midnight / 60;
        std::int32_t minutes = minutes_since_midnight % 60;
        
        // Since minutes_since_midnight is always between 0 and 1439, hours will be between 0 and 23
        // So no need to check for negative values
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << minutes;
        return oss.str();
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue: when hours could be more than 23, but since minutes_since_midnight is always between 0 and 1439, hours will always be between 0 and 23. So we're good.

Wait, but when we call clock::at(0, minutes_since_midnight + minutes_to_add), it will handle the normalization correctly, which is better than doing it manually.

This implementation ensures that:
1. All times are always valid (between 00:00 and 23:59)
2. Adding and subtracting minutes correctly wraps around the clock
3. The string representation is always in HH:MM format with leading zeros

This should now handle cases where:
- Adding minutes causes the time to wrap past midnight
- Subtracting minutes causes the time to wrap before midnight
- The time is always normalized to a valid 24-hour format

Let's also make sure that the implementation follows the MISRA C++ rules:
1. We're using std::int32_t which is appropriate
2. All operations are between the same types
3. We're using parentheses where necessary to make operator precedence clear

This implementation should now be correct. Let's run through some examples:
- clock::at(8, 0).plus(45) -> "08:45"
- clock::at(9, 0).minus(15) -> "08:45"
- clock::at(0, 0).minus(50) -> "23:10" (since 0 - 50 = -50 minutes, which normalized is 1440 - 50 = 1390 minutes -> 23*60 + 10)
