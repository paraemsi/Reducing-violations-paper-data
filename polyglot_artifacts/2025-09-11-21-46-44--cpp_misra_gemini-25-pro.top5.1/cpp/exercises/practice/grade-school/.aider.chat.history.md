#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.  
####   
#### In the end, you should be able to:  
####   
#### - Add a student's name to the roster for a grade  
####   - "Add Jim to grade 2."  
####   - "OK."  
#### - Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade  
####   - "Which students are in grade 2?"  
####   - "We've only got Jim just now."  
#### - Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  
####   Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.  
####   - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"  
####   - "Let me think.  
####     We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.  
####     So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"  
####   
#### Note that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.  
#### In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grade_school.h grade_school.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not use the keywords signed/unsigned char, short, int, long, or long long (and their unsigned forms) for variables, parameters, or return types.    
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types such as std::int8_t, std::uint16_t, std::int32_t, std::uint64_t, or project-specific typedefs/aliases that wrap them.    
#### - int is permitted only for the main() return type, its parameters (argc, argv), and as the dummy int in postfix ++/-- operators; avoid it elsewhere.    
#### - Typedef/using declarations that create aliases are allowed and encouraged for readability.    
#### - Plain char is covered by another rule; avoid it for integers.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Parenthesize every sub-expression that combines binary or ternary operators with different precedence levels ( *, /, %, +, -, <<, >>, <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, &, ^, |, &&, ||, ?: ).    
#### - Omit parentheses only when adjacent operators share the exact same precedence and associativity (e.g. `a + b - c`, `x & y ^ z`).    
#### - Unary operators may remain unparenthesized when used inside a larger expression (`a * -b` is OK).    
#### - Never rely on default precedence in conditions, assignments, returns, or initializers; make evaluation order explicit: `if ((a == 1) && (b > 0))`, `val = a * (b + 1);`.    
#### - Treat overloaded operators with the same caution; add parentheses for clarity even if the rule does not mandate it.    
#### - Example pitfalls: avoid `a * b + 1`, `if (a + b != c - d)`, `if (x == 0 && y > 1)`; rewrite with parentheses.  
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep numeric assignments strictly safe: identical type category, signedness and size, or an allowed widening/constant case    
#### - OK: same category & signedness, destination wider, source is a single variable (id-expression) ‒ e.g. `uint32_t big = small8;`    
#### - OK: floating-point constant → wider floating type ‒ e.g. `long double ld = 1.0f;`    
#### - OK: integer constant/constant expression → any numeric type (or bit-field) whose range can hold the value ‒ e.g. `float f = 42;`, `uint8_t u = 255;`    
#### - Otherwise: do NOT assign, initialise, pass by value, return, or use in a `case` label    
####   • No wider→narrower size (e.g. `uint8_t u = uint32_t_val;`)    
####   • No signed↔unsigned change (e.g. `uint32_t = int32_t;`)    
####   • No integer↔floating conversion except the constant cases above    
####   • No value that exceeds target range    
#### - For widening, use a variable, not an arithmetic expression; if you must convert, use an explicit cast that yields a compliant source type first    
#### - Apply the same checks in constructors, default arguments, lambda captures, operator calls, etc. ‒ every by-value transfer counts as an assignment    
#### - Treat unscoped enums as their underlying integral type when checking these rules  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Never convert character types (‘char’, ‘signed/unsigned char’, ‘wchar_t’, ‘char16_t’, ‘char32_t’) to or from any non-character arithmetic type (int, bool, enum, float, …); forbid both implicit assignments and casts.    
#### - Do not perform arithmetic, bitwise, relational (<, >, <=, >=), or ++/-- on character objects; only == and != between identical character types are allowed.    
#### - Initialise/assign character variables exclusively with character literals of the same category (e.g., char c = '\n'; wchar_t w = L'x';), not numeric constants.    
#### - When an integer representation is unavoidable, use library helpers such as std::char_traits<CharT>::to_int_type(), never rely on direct conversion.    
#### - Use <cctype>/<cwctype> utilities (std::isalpha, std::tolower, …) instead of numeric range checks on characters.    
#### - Raw byte or small-integer data should be held in std::byte, std::uint8_t, or int8_t, not in char-family types.    
#### - Unevaluated operands (sizeof, decltype, alignof) and casts to void of a function call returning a character are permissible.  
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always wrap the body of every `if` in `{ … }`, even if it is a single statement    
#### - Always wrap the body of every `else` in `{ … }`; braces may be omitted only when the `else` is immediately followed by another `if` (`else if`)    
#### - Do not place any non-braced statement directly after `if (…)` or `else`    
#### - Never write `if (condition);` — replace with a braced empty block or remove the statement    
#### - Keep braces and indentation consistent so the controlled block is visually unambiguous  
####   
#### The numeric value of an unscoped enumeration with no fixed underlying type shall not be used  
#### - Declare enums as `enum class` or give them an explicit underlying type (e.g. `enum Mode : std::uint8_t`); avoid plain `enum Mode { … };`.  
#### - For an unscoped enum without a fixed underlying type:  
####   • Do NOT use it with any arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or compound-assignment operator.    
####   • Only compare it (`==, !=, <, >, <=, >=`) with another value of the same enum type.    
####   • In `switch (e)`, every `case` label must be an enumerator of that same enum.    
####   • Only assign/initialize/return/pass it to the same enum type; if an integral value is required, first cast to an integer type wide enough to hold every enumerator.    
####   • `static_cast` is permitted only to a sufficiently wide integer type; never cast to another enum or to a too-narrow integer.    
#### - If you need numeric manipulation, either cast the value to a wide integer first or redesign the enum as `enum class` / fixed-width to remove the restriction.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

Based on your instructions, I will implement the grade school roster functionality.

Here are the changes I'll make:
1.  In `grade_school.h`, I will define the `school` class within the `grade_school` namespace. This class will manage the student roster. It will include methods to add a student, get students in a specific grade, and get the entire roster. I will use a `std::map` with `std::int32_t` as the key for the grade and `std::vector<std::string>` for the list of students.

2.  In `grade_school.cpp`, I will implement the methods of the `school` class:
    *   `add()`: This will add a student to a grade. Before adding, it will check if the student already exists in the roster to prevent duplicates. After adding, it will sort the list of students in that grade alphabetically.
    *   `grade()`: This will return a sorted list of students for a given grade.
    *   `roster()`: This will return the entire roster, with grades sorted numerically and students sorted alphabetically within each grade.

Here are the `SEARCH/REPLACE` blocks for the requested changes.

Based on the problem description and your code, the main issue is in the `add` method's implementation in `grade_school.cpp`. The current logic prevents a student from being moved to a different grade because it exits as soon as it finds the student's name anywhere in the roster.

A student should be able to move from one grade to another. To fix this, I will modify the `add` method to:
1.  Check if a student already exists in the roster.
2.  If the student is already in the target grade, do nothing.
3.  If the student is in a different grade, remove them from the old grade.
4.  If the student is new or was moved, add them to the new grade and sort the grade's student list.

This ensures that a student can be added, moved, and cannot exist in more than one grade at a time, fulfilling the requirements. The `grade()` and `roster()` methods are correct as they are.

Here is the `SEARCH/REPLACE` block to update `grade_school.cpp`:

```cpp
grade_school.cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
void school::add(const std::string& name, std::int32_t grade) {
    for (const auto& pair : student_roster) {
        const auto& students = pair.second;
        if (std::find(students.cbegin(), students.cend(), name) != students.cend()) {
            return;
        }
    }

    student_roster[grade].push_back(name);
    std::sort(student_roster[grade].begin(), student_roster[grade].end());
}
=======
void school::add(const std::string& name, std::int32_t grade) {
    std::int32_t old_grade = -1;

    for (auto& pair : student_roster) {
        auto& students = pair.second;
        auto it = std::find(students.begin(), students.end(), name);

        if (it != students.end()) {
            // Student is already in the roster.
            if (pair.first == grade) {
                // Already in the correct grade.
                return;
            }
            // In a different grade. Remove from old grade.
            old_grade = pair.first;
            students.erase(it);
            break;
        }
    }

    // If student was moved, the old grade might be empty.
    if (old_grade != -1) {
        if (student_roster.at(old_grade).empty()) {
            student_roster.erase(old_grade);
        }
    }

    // Add student to new grade.
    student_roster[grade].push_back(name);
    std::sort(student_roster[grade].begin(), student_roster[grade].end());
