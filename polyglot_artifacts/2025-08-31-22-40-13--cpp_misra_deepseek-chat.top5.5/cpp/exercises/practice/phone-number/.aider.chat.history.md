#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Clean up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.  
####   
#### The **North American Numbering Plan (NANP)** is a telephone numbering system used by many countries in North America like the United States, Canada or Bermuda.  
#### All NANP-countries share the same international country code: `1`.  
####   
#### NANP numbers are ten-digit numbers consisting of a three-digit Numbering Plan Area code, commonly known as _area code_, followed by a seven-digit local number.  
#### The first three digits of the local number represent the _exchange code_, followed by the unique four-digit number which is the _subscriber number_.  
####   
#### The format is usually represented as  
####   
#### ```text  
#### NXX NXX-XXXX  
#### ```  
####   
#### where `N` is any digit from 2 through 9 and `X` is any digit from 0 through 9.  
####   
#### Sometimes they also have the country code (represented as `1` or `+1`) prefixed.  
####   
#### Your task is to clean up differently formatted telephone numbers by removing punctuation and the country code if present.  
####   
#### For example, the inputs  
####   
#### - `+1 (613)-995-0253`  
#### - `613-995-0253`  
#### - `1 613 995 0253`  
#### - `613.995.0253`  
####   
#### should all produce the output  
####   
#### `6139950253`  
####   
#### **Note:** As this exercise only deals with telephone numbers used in NANP-countries, only 1 is considered a valid country code.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: phone_number.cpp phone_number.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a function to clean up phone numbers according to the NANP format. Let's think through this carefully.

Since this is C++, we'll need to add a function to the phone_number namespace. Let's create a class or function that takes a string and returns the cleaned number. However, the instructions don't specify the exact interface, so we'll need to be careful.

Since the files are mostly empty, we need to define the interface. Let's add a function that takes a string and returns a string. We'll also need to handle invalid numbers by throwing an exception.

Wait, the instructions say to clean up the numbers, which implies removing non-digit characters and the country code if present, and then validating the result.

Let's implement:
1. Remove all non-digit characters
2. Check if the number has 10 digits (valid)
3. Check if the number has 11 digits and starts with '1' (remove '1' prefix)
4. Validate that the area code and exchange code start with digits 2-9

Here's the implementation:

First, let's update the header file to declare the function:

phone_number.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PHONE_NUMBER_H)
#define PHONE_NUMBER_H

namespace phone_number {

}  // namespace phone_number

#endif // PHONE_NUMBER_H
=======
#if !defined(PHONE_NUMBER_H)
#define PHONE_NUMBER_H

#include <string>

namespace phone_number {

class phone_number {
public:
    explicit phone_number(const std::string& number);
    std::string number() const;
    std::string area_code() const;
    operator std::string() const;
private:
    std::string cleaned_number;
};

}  // namespace phone_number

#endif // PHONE_NUMBER_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the functionality in the cpp file:

phone_number.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "phone_number.h"

namespace phone_number {

}  // namespace phone_number
=======
#include "phone_number.h"
#include <string>
#include <cctype>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace phone_number {

phone_number::phone_number(const std::string& number) {
    // First, extract all digits
    std::string digits;
    for (char c : number) {
        if (std::isdigit(static_cast<unsigned char>(c))) {
            digits.push_back(c);
        }
    }
    
    // Check the number of digits
    if (digits.size() == 11) {
        if (digits[0] == '1') {
            cleaned_number = digits.substr(1);
        } else {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid country code");
        }
    } else if (digits.size() == 10) {
        cleaned_number = digits;
    } else {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid number of digits");
    }
    
    // Validate area code and exchange code
    if (cleaned_number.size() != 10) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid number");
    }
    
    // Check area code (first 3 digits)
    if ((cleaned_number[0] < '2') || (cleaned_number[0] > '9')) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Area code cannot start with 0 or 1");
    }
    
    // Check exchange code (digits 3-5)
    if ((cleaned_number[3] < '2') || (cleaned_number[3] > '9')) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Exchange code cannot start with 0 or 1");
    }
}

std::string phone_number::number() const {
    return cleaned_number;
}

std::string phone_number::area_code() const {
    return cleaned_number.substr(0, 3);
}

phone_number::operator std::string() const {
    // Format as NXX NXX-XXXX
    return "(" + cleaned_number.substr(0, 3) + ") " + 
           cleaned_number.substr(3, 3) + "-" + 
           cleaned_number.substr(6);
}

}  // namespace phone_number
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, the instructions only ask to clean up the number, which suggests we might just need a function to clean and validate, not a class. But since the tests may expect a class interface, we'll proceed with this approach.

Wait, the instructions say to clean up the number to produce a 10-digit string, which matches the number() member function. The area_code() and string conversion might be for additional functionality that tests expect.

This implementation should handle:
1. Removing non-digit characters
2. Validating and removing the country code if present
3. Validating the area code and exchange code start with digits 2-9
4. Throwing exceptions for invalid numbers

However, we need to be careful about character comparisons. Since we're comparing digits, which are guaranteed to be '0'-'9', it's fine to use relational operators. But to follow the rules, we need to ensure we're not using numerical values of characters.

This implementation uses character literals which is allowed:
```cpp
if ((cleaned_number[0] < '2') || (cleaned_number[0] > '9'))
```

This is comparing characters to character literals, which is valid under the rules:
"Equality comparisons == / != between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed."

Wait, but we're using < and > which are relational operators. This might violate the rules. Let's think of another approach.

Actually, we can convert each digit to its integer value and then compare:
```cpp
int digit = cleaned_number[0] - '0';
if (digit < 2 || digit > 9)
```

But this uses numerical values of characters, which violates the rules. So we need to find another way.

Wait, the rules say:
"Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (<, >, <=, >=), logical, or boolean-context expressions"

So we need to find a way to check if the character is between '2' and '9' without using relational operators. We can use a lookup or switch:
```cpp
bool is_valid_start(char c) {
    switch(c) {
        case '2': case '3': case '4': case '5':
        case '6': case '7': case '8': case '9':
            return true;
        default:
            return false;
    }
}
```

This uses only equality comparisons which are allowed. Let's implement this approach.

I understand. We need to fix the implementation to comply with the given rules, especially regarding character handling. Let's address the issues:

1. We're using relational operators (<, >) with characters which violates the rules
2. We need to ensure all if/else statements use compound statements
3. We need to use fixed-width integer types where appropriate

Let's fix these issues:

First, we'll create helper functions to check if a character is a valid area code or exchange code digit without using relational operators:

phone_number.cpp

```

This implementation uses a helper function `is_valid_nanp_digit` that uses a switch statement to check if a character is between '2' and '9' without using relational operators, which complies with the rules.

However, we need to ensure all if/else statements use compound statements. Let's check:

1. All if and else blocks are using {} which is good
2. The switch statement is fine
3. We're using character equality comparisons which are allowed

This implementation should now comply with the given rules:
- No numerical values of characters are used
- All if/else statements use compound statements
- No relational operators are used on characters
- Only equality comparisons are used for characters

However, we need to make sure that all if/else statements have braces, which they do:
- Every if and else block uses {} even if they contain a single statement
- The else if is actually an else followed by an if, which is allowed without additional braces around the if part

This implementation should now be correct and follow all the specified rules. Let's run through some test cases:
- Valid numbers with various formats should produce the 10-digit number
- Numbers with invalid country codes should throw
- Numbers with invalid area codes or exchange codes should throw
- Numbers with the wrong number of digits should throw

This should now be ready to use.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in phone_number.cpp phone_number.h to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests expect `std::domain_error` to be thrown, but our implementation is throwing `std::invalid_argument`. Let's fix that. Also, we need to ensure that numbers with non-digit characters are handled correctly (they should be removed, not cause an error).

Here are the necessary fixes:

1. Change all `std::invalid_argument` to `std::domain_error`
2. Make sure we're always extracting digits first, then validating
3. Ensure numbers with letters or punctuation are processed by removing non-digits

Here are the required changes:

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change replaces all instances of `std::invalid_argument` with `std::domain_error` to match what the tests expect. The rest of the implementation remains the same, which should correctly handle:

1. Extracting digits from the input string, ignoring non-digit characters
2. Validating the number of digits (10 or 11 with leading '1')
3. Validating area code and exchange code start with digits 2-9
4. Throwing appropriate exceptions when validation fails

This should now pass the tests that were failing due to the wrong exception type being thrown. Let's see if this resolves the issues:

- Numbers with letters or punctuation will have non-digit characters removed, then be validated based on the remaining digits
- Invalid numbers will throw `std::domain_error` which is what the tests expect
- Valid numbers will be processed correctly

This implementation should now handle all the test cases correctly. Let's hope this fixes the issues!
