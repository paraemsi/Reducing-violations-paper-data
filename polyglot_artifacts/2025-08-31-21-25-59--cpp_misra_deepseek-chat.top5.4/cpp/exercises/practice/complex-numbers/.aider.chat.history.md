#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.  
####   
#### `a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.  
#### The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.  
#### The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.  
####   
#### The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:  
#### `(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,  
#### `(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.  
####   
#### Multiplication result is by definition  
#### `(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.  
####   
#### The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is  
#### `1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:  
#### `(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Raising e to a complex exponent can be expressed as `e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`, the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,  
#### - conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.  
####   
#### Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: complex_numbers.h complex_numbers.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I'll implement a complex number class with the required operations. Let's start by defining the class structure and then implement each operation.

Since we need to use floating point numbers, we'll use `double` for real and imaginary parts. Let's proceed:

First, let's update the header file to declare the Complex class and its operations:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    
    // Operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement each of these operations in the .cpp file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "complex_numbers.h"

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
#include "complex_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

Complex::Complex(double real, double imag) : real_(real), imag_(imag) {}

double Complex::real() const {
    return real_;
}

double Complex::imag() const {
    return imag_;
}

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ + other.real_), (imag_ + other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ - other.real_), (imag_ - other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}

Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_, -imag_);
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex(magnitude * std::cos(imag_), magnitude * std::sin(imag_));
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all operations follow the MISRA C++ rules. Let's check:

1. We're using `double` which is appropriate for floating point numbers
2. All operations are properly parenthesized
3. All if/else statements would need braces, but there are none in this implementation
4. No character numerical values are being used
5. No integer types are being used inappropriately

This implementation should work. Let's break down some key points:
- The real and imaginary parts are stored as doubles
- Each operation is implemented according to the mathematical formulas provided
- The exp() function uses Euler's formula
- All operations return new Complex objects
- The implementation uses proper member functions and operator overloading

This implementation should be complete and follow the instructions. Let me know if you have any questions or need further modifications.

I don't see any errors in the provided code. The implementation looks correct and follows the mathematical definitions. However, the user mentioned "See relevant lines below marked with █" which might indicate there are specific issues, but none are visible in the provided text.

Since the implementation seems correct, perhaps the issue is with the unit tests or how the code is being used. But since I can only see these two files, I'll assume the implementation is correct.

However, let's make sure all operations are properly implemented according to the instructions:

1. Addition: (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i
2. Subtraction: (a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i
3. Multiplication: (a + bi) * (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (bc + ad)i
4. Division: (a + bi) / (c + di) = [(ac + bd)/(c² + d²)] + [(bc - ad)/(c² + d²)]i
5. Conjugate: conj(a + bi) = a - bi
6. Absolute value: |a + bi| = sqrt(a² + b²)
7. Exponential: exp(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))

All these are correctly implemented. Let's also check if there are any potential issues:
1. Division by zero: If the denominator is zero, it will cause a division by zero error. But the instructions don't specify how to handle this, so we'll assume valid inputs.
2. The exp() function uses std::exp, std::cos, and std::sin which are correct.

Since the user sees some errors, perhaps there are specific requirements from the unit tests that aren't being met. But without seeing those, it's hard to say.

Wait, the user might be referring to the fact that the functions are not marked as const where they should be. But they are all marked as const.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Let's run through a quick mental test:
- All operations return new Complex numbers
- The implementation matches the mathematical formulas
- The functions are properly declared and defined

Perhaps the issue is with the provided code not matching what's expected. Let's make sure the interface matches what the tests expect.

Since the user provided the files, and I don't see any errors, I'll assume the implementation is correct. If there are specific errors, please provide more details.

I understand. The tests are trying to perform operations between Complex numbers and doubles, but our implementation only supports operations between Complex numbers. We need to add support for these mixed-type operations.

Let's add non-member operator overloads to handle cases where doubles are on either side of the operators. These need to be friends or defined in a way that allows conversion of doubles to Complex numbers.

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    
    // Operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    
    // Operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Add operators for Complex + double, etc.
    Complex operator+(double other) const;
    Complex operator-(double other) const;
    Complex operator*(double other) const;
    Complex operator/(double other) const;
    
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
};

// Add operators for double + Complex, etc.
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these new operators in the .cpp file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "complex_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

Complex::Complex(double real, double imag) : real_(real), imag_(imag) {}

double Complex::real() const {
    return real_;
}

double Complex::imag() const {
    return imag_;
}

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ + other.real_), (imag_ + other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ - other.real_), (imag_ - other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}

Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_, -imag_);
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex(magnitude * std::cos(imag_), magnitude * std::sin(imag_));
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
#include "complex_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

Complex::Complex(double real, double imag) : real_(real), imag_(imag) {}

double Complex::real() const {
    return real_;
}

double Complex::imag() const {
    return imag_;
}

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ + other.real_), (imag_ + other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ - other.real_), (imag_ - other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

// Implement the new member operators
Complex Complex::operator+(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ + other), imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ - other), imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ * other), (imag_ * other));
}

Complex Complex::operator/(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ / other), (imag_ / other));
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}

Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_, -imag_);
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex(magnitude * std::cos(imag_), magnitude * std::sin(imag_));
}

// Implement non-member operators
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs + rhs.real()), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs - rhs.real()), -rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real()), (lhs * rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To divide a real number by a complex number, we can treat the real number as a complex number with imaginary part 0
    // and use the complex division formula
    Complex numerator(lhs, 0.0);
    return numerator / rhs;
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should now handle all the cases where doubles are used with Complex numbers:
1. Complex + double
2. double + Complex
3. Complex - double
4. double - Complex
5. Complex * double
6. double * Complex
7. Complex / double
8. double / Complex

The implementation for division of a double by a Complex number uses the complex division formula by treating the double as a complex number with zero imaginary part. This is mathematically correct.

These changes should now allow the tests to compile and pass. Let me know if there are any further issues.

I don't see any errors in the provided code. The implementation looks correct and matches the interface. However, the user may be referring to potential issues that aren't visible in the provided text.

Since the implementation seems correct, perhaps there are issues with the tests or other requirements. Let's make sure everything is properly implemented according to the mathematical definitions and the MISRA C++ rules mentioned earlier.

Wait, the user mentioned "See relevant lines below marked with █" which might indicate there are specific issues, but none are visible in the provided text. Since I can't see any errors, I'll assume the implementation is correct.

However, let's make sure all operations are properly parenthesized according to the MISRA rules:

Wait, the implementation needs to follow the MISRA rules about parentheses:
1. Always parenthesize binary operations when they are operands of other operators
2. Wrap relational or equality tests before combining with &&, ||, or ?:
3. Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in other expressions

Let's check if our implementation follows these rules. For example:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);

These already seem to be properly parenthesized. Let's also check the abs() function:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}
=======
double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This is also properly parenthesized.

Since I can't see any actual errors, and the implementation seems correct, perhaps the user is referring to something else. Let's wait for more information.

However, if there are specific compilation errors or test failures, please provide those details so I can address them directly.
