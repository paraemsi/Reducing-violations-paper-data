#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.  
####   
#### `a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.  
#### The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.  
#### The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.  
####   
#### The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:  
#### `(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,  
#### `(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.  
####   
#### Multiplication result is by definition  
#### `(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.  
####   
#### The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is  
#### `1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:  
#### `(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Raising e to a complex exponent can be expressed as `e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`, the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,  
#### - conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.  
####   
#### Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: complex_numbers.cpp complex_numbers.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I'll implement a complex number class with the required operations. Let's start by defining the class structure in the header file and then implement the methods in the source file.

Since we need to use floating point numbers, we'll use `double` for the real and imaginary parts. However, according to the rules, we need to be careful about types. Since `double` is a standard floating point type and not an integer type, it should be fine.

Here are the planned operations:
1. Constructor to initialize real and imaginary parts
2. Real part accessor
3. Imaginary part accessor
4. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division operators
5. Conjugate, absolute value, exponent functions
6. Implement these as member functions where appropriate

Let's proceed:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    
    // Operators
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these methods in the source file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "complex_numbers.h"

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
#include "complex_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

Complex::Complex(double real, double imag) : real_(real), imag_(imag) {}

double Complex::real() const {
    return real_;
}

double Complex::imag() const {
    return imag_;
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}

Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_, -imag_);
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex(magnitude * std::cos(imag_), magnitude * std::sin(imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_ + other.real_, imag_ + other.imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_ - other.real_, imag_ - other.imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all operations follow the rules:
1. All binary operations are parenthesized correctly
2. No integer types are used where floating point types should be used
3. All operations are appropriate

Wait, the implementation seems to follow the rules:
1. All expressions are properly parenthesized
2. We're using `double` consistently
3. No integer types are being used inappropriately
4. All operations are between floating point numbers

This implementation should work for the requirements:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are implemented using the formulas provided
- Conjugate, absolute value, and exponent are implemented as member functions
- All operations return new Complex numbers

However, the instructions don't specify whether these should be member functions or free functions. Since the tests may expect certain interfaces, and the implementation uses member functions, this should be fine. If there are issues, we can adjust.

Let me know if there are any specific requirements about the interface that need to be addressed.

I don't see any errors in the provided code. The implementation looks correct according to the instructions. However, there might be some issues that aren't visible in the provided snippets. Let me think about potential problems:

1. The implementation uses `double` which is appropriate for real and imaginary parts
2. All operations follow the mathematical definitions
3. The interface seems complete

Wait, the instructions say to not change existing function names, but the provided code shows a class-based approach. Maybe the tests expect a different interface? But since the user provided these files, they must be correct.

Perhaps there are some precision issues or edge cases:
1. Division by zero: When the denominator is zero in division, it will produce infinity or NaN
2. But the instructions don't specify how to handle this, so we'll assume valid inputs

Since the user says there are errors, but none are visible, I need to be careful. Let's ensure all operations are properly parenthesized according to the rules:

Wait, the rules say:
"Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression."

Let's check the implementation:
1. In `abs()`: `(real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_)` - this is fine
2. In `operator*`: `(real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_)` - each multiplication is in parentheses, which is good
3. In `operator/`: The divisions are at the end, and numerators are properly parenthesized

Wait, the rules also say:
"Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`."
But there are no such tests in the implementation.

Actually, the implementation seems to follow all the rules:
1. No integer types are used where they shouldn't be
2. All expressions are properly parenthesized
3. All operations are between floating point numbers
4. No character types are used

Since I can't see any errors, and the implementation seems correct, perhaps the user wants to see if there are any improvements or if I missed something.

Wait, the exponent function: `exp()` is a member function that returns `e^z` where z is the complex number. This matches the instruction:
"exponent of a given complex number" which is `e^z`

This seems correct.

Since I can't identify any issues, I'll assume the implementation is correct. If there are specific errors, the user will need to provide more information.

I understand. The tests are trying to perform operations between Complex numbers and doubles, but our implementation only supports operations between Complex numbers. We need to add overloads to handle these cases.

Since a double can be treated as a complex number with zero imaginary part, we can implement these operations by converting the double to a Complex number implicitly or explicitly. However, to avoid modifying the constructor, we'll add appropriate operator overloads.

Let's add non-member operator overloads to handle Complex + double, double + Complex, etc. These need to be friends or use the public interface.

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    // Operators
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
=======
    // Operators
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Friend operators for operations with doubles
    friend Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these in the source file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
=======
Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

// Implement friend operators
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real_ + rhs, lhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs + rhs.real_, rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real_ - rhs, lhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs - rhs.real_, -rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real_ * rhs, lhs.imag_ * rhs);
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs * rhs.real_, lhs * rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real_ / rhs, lhs.imag_ / rhs);
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // Treat lhs as a complex number (lhs + 0i)
    // Use the complex division formula
    double denominator = (rhs.real_ * rhs.real_) + (rhs.imag_ * rhs.imag_);
    double real_part = (lhs * rhs.real_) / denominator;
    double imag_part = (-lhs * rhs.imag_) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These implementations will handle operations between Complex numbers and doubles by treating the double as a complex number with zero imaginary part:
1. Addition and subtraction are straightforward
2. Multiplication scales both real and imaginary parts
3. Division either scales both parts (when dividing by a double) or uses the complex division formula (when dividing a double by a complex number)

This should now pass all the test cases that were failing:
- c + 5.0 -> Complex + double
- 5.0 + c -> double + Complex
- c - 4.0 -> Complex - double
- 4.0 - c -> double - Complex
- c * 5.0 -> Complex * double
- 5.0 * c -> double * Complex
- c / 10.0 -> Complex / double
- 5.0 / c -> double / Complex

Note: All operations are properly parenthesized according to the rules, and we're using floating point types consistently.

I don't see any errors in the provided code. The implementation looks complete and should handle all the operations that were causing errors. However, since the user is asking to fix errors, there might be some issues that aren't immediately visible.

Wait, the friend functions are declared within the class, but they need to be defined in the namespace scope. The implementation in the .cpp file looks correct, but perhaps there's a linking issue because the friend functions aren't properly declared.

Actually, friend functions declared inside a class are in the enclosing namespace, which is complex_numbers. The implementations in the .cpp file are also in the complex_numbers namespace, which is correct.

Perhaps the issue is that the friend functions need to be declared outside the class as well? But that's not necessary.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Let's make sure all the operators are properly implemented:
1. All binary operations between Complex and double are handled
2. All operations follow the mathematical definitions
3. The implementations are in the correct namespace

Since I can't see any errors, and the implementation seems correct, perhaps the tests are passing now. If there are still issues, the user will need to provide more specific error messages.

However, to be thorough, let's ensure all operations are properly parenthesized according to the rules:
1. All binary operations are properly parenthesized
2. No integer types are being used inappropriately
3. All operations are between floating point numbers

The implementation looks good:
- All expressions are properly parenthesized
- We're using `double` consistently
- No integer types are being used where they shouldn't be

Since the user provided the files and asked to fix errors, but I can't see any, perhaps the implementation is now correct and the tests will pass. If there are specific errors, please provide them.
