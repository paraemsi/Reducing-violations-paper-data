#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement the classic method for composing secret messages called a square code.  
####   
#### Given an English text, output the encoded version of that text.  
####   
#### First, the input is normalized: the spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the message is down-cased.  
####   
#### Then, the normalized characters are broken into rows.  
#### These rows can be regarded as forming a rectangle when printed with intervening newlines.  
####   
#### For example, the sentence  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "If man was meant to stay on the ground, god would have given us roots."  
#### ```  
####   
#### is normalized to:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "ifmanwasmeanttostayonthegroundgodwouldhavegivenusroots"  
#### ```  
####   
#### The plaintext should be organized into a rectangle as square as possible.  
#### The size of the rectangle should be decided by the length of the message.  
####   
#### If `c` is the number of columns and `r` is the number of rows, then for the rectangle `r` x `c` find the smallest possible integer `c` such that:  
####   
#### - `r * c >= length of message`,  
#### - and `c >= r`,  
#### - and `c - r <= 1`.  
####   
#### Our normalized text is 54 characters long, dictating a rectangle with `c = 8` and `r = 7`:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "ifmanwas"  
#### "meanttos"  
#### "tayonthe"  
#### "groundgo"  
#### "dwouldha"  
#### "vegivenu"  
#### "sroots  "  
#### ```  
####   
#### The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right.  
####   
#### The message above is coded as:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvsfearwermayoogoanouuiontnnlvtwttddesaohghnsseoau"  
#### ```  
####   
#### Output the encoded text in chunks that fill perfect rectangles `(r X c)`, with `c` chunks of `r` length, separated by spaces.  
#### For phrases that are `n` characters short of the perfect rectangle, pad each of the last `n` chunks with a single trailing space.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn  sseoau "  
#### ```  
####   
#### Notice that were we to stack these, we could visually decode the ciphertext back in to the original message:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvs"  
#### "fearwer"  
#### "mayoogo"  
#### "anouuio"  
#### "ntnnlvt"  
#### "wttddes"  
#### "aohghn "  
#### "sseoau "  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: crypto_square.h crypto_square.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

I understand. Let's implement the crypto square cipher. We need to process the input text by normalizing it, organizing it into a rectangle, and then reading down the columns to produce the encoded output.

First, let's plan the implementation:
1. Normalize the input: remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
2. Determine the number of columns (c) and rows (r)
3. Organize the normalized text into a grid
4. Read down the columns to get the encoded text
5. Format the output by grouping into chunks of length r, separated by spaces

Since we need to add this to the provided files, we'll need to define a class or function in the header and implement it in the cpp file.

However, the provided files are empty. Let's add a class or function to implement this functionality. Since the instructions don't specify, I'll assume we need to implement a function that takes a string and returns the encoded string.

Wait, the namespace is already defined, so we can add a function within that namespace.

Here's the implementation:

crypto_square.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CRYPTO_SQUARE_H)
#define CRYPTO_SQUARE_H

namespace crypto_square {

}  // namespace crypto_square

#endif // CRYPTO_SQUARE_H
=======
#if !defined(CRYPTO_SQUARE_H)
#define CRYPTO_SQUARE_H

#include <string>

namespace crypto_square {

std::string cipher_text(const std::string& text);

}  // namespace crypto_square

#endif // CRYPTO_SQUARE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in crypto_square.cpp:

crypto_square.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "crypto_square.h"

namespace crypto_square {

}  // namespace crypto_square
=======
#include "crypto_square.h"
#include <string>
#include <cctype>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

namespace crypto_square {

std::string cipher_text(const std::string& text) {
    // Normalize the input
    std::string normalized;
    for (char ch : text) {
        if (std::isalnum(static_cast<unsigned char>(ch))) {
            normalized += std::tolower(static_cast<unsigned char>(ch));
        }
    }
    
    // Handle empty string
    if (normalized.empty()) {
        return "";
    }
    
    // Determine number of columns and rows
    std::size_t length = normalized.size();
    std::size_t c = 0;
    std::size_t r = 0;
    
    // Find the smallest c where c >= r and c - r <= 1 and r * c >= length
    // Start by finding the integer square root
    // Since c >= r and c - r <= 1, c is either floor(sqrt(n)) or ceil(sqrt(n))
    // And r is the other value
    c = static_cast<std::size_t>(std::ceil(std::sqrt(length)));
    r = (length + c - 1) / c; // This ensures r*c >= length
    
    // Adjust to meet conditions
    // We need to find c and r such that c >= r and c - r <= 1
    // Let's find the right values
    // Since c is the ceiling of the square root, and r is the floor, but we need to adjust
    while (true) {
        if ((c >= r) && ((c - r) <= 1) && ((r * c) >= length)) {
            break;
        }
        // Adjust c and r
        if (c < r) {
            c++;
        } else if ((c - r) > 1) {
            r++;
        } else {
            c++;
        }
    }
    
    // Pad the normalized string with spaces to fill the rectangle
    normalized.append(r * c - length, ' ');
    
    // Organize into a grid and read down the columns
    std::vector<std::string> result_chunks;
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < c; i++) {
        std::string chunk;
        for (std::size_t j = 0; j < r; j++) {
            chunk += normalized[j * c + i];
        }
        result_chunks.push_back(chunk);
    }
    
    // Join the chunks with spaces
    std::string result;
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < result_chunks.size(); i++) {
        if (i != 0) {
            result += " ";
        }
        result += result_chunks[i];
    }
    
    return result;
}

}  // namespace crypto_square
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The conditions for c and r need to be met precisely
2. The implementation needs to find the right c and r values
3. We need to pad the normalized text to fill the rectangle
4. Then read down the columns to form the encoded text

Wait, the implementation to find c and r can be optimized. Since c >= r and c - r <= 1, and r * c >= length, c is always ceiling(sqrt(length)) and r is floor(sqrt(length)) or ceiling(sqrt(length))
But sometimes this may not satisfy all conditions, so we need to adjust.

Actually, for the given example:
length = 54
sqrt(54) ≈ 7.348
c = 8, r = 7
8 >= 7 and 8-7=1 <=1 and 7*8=56 >=54 ✔

This matches, so our initial approach seems correct.

However, to always find the right values, we can start with c = ceiling(sqrt(length)), and r = floor(sqrt(length))
Then adjust until r*c >= length while maintaining c >= r and c-r <=1

But to ensure we always find the smallest c, we can increment c until r*c >= length, and set r to ceiling(length/c)
But need to make sure c >= r and c-r <=1

This seems tricky. Let's implement a more reliable approach:
Start with r = floor(sqrt(length)), c = r
Then while r*c < length, increment the smaller of c and r, making sure c always >= r and c-r <=1

But to always find the minimum c, we can:
1. Start with c = ceiling(sqrt(length))
2. Set r = ceiling(length / static_cast<double>(c))
3. Check if c >= r and c-r <=1
4. If not, increment c and go to step 2

This should work.

Wait, the implementation above uses a while loop which should find the correct values. Let's proceed.

I understand. Let's fix the implementation to properly handle the conditions for determining the number of columns and rows. The implementation needs to find the smallest number of columns (c) where:
1. r * c >= length of normalized text
2. c >= r
3. c - r <= 1

Since c must be at least as large as r, and they can differ by at most 1, this means c is always ceiling(sqrt(length)) and r is floor(sqrt(length)), but we need to adjust if their product isn't at least the length.

However, sometimes floor(sqrt(length)) * ceiling(sqrt(length)) may be less than length, in which case we need to increase c and r appropriately while maintaining the conditions.

Wait, the conditions imply that c and r are always either equal or c is exactly one more than r. So we can find the smallest c where:
c >= ceil(sqrt(length)) and there exists an r where:
r = ceil(length / c)
c >= r
c - r <= 1

But to always satisfy c >= r and c - r <= 1, r must be either equal to c or c-1
So we need to find the smallest c where r = ceil(length / c) and (r == c or r == c-1)

Let's implement this properly:

Here's the revised implementation:

```

This implementation should now correctly handle finding the appropriate number of columns and rows that meet the given conditions:
1. r * c >= length of normalized text
2. c >= r
3. c - r <= 1

It starts by finding the ceiling of the square root of the length, which gives us a starting point. Then it adjusts c and r to meet all conditions while ensuring r * c is at least the length of the normalized text.

However, there's a potential issue: we need to find the smallest possible integer c that satisfies the conditions. The implementation above may not always find the smallest c, but it should work within the constraints.

Let's test this approach with the provided example:
Normalized length: 54
sqrt(54) ≈ 7.348 → c starts at 8
r starts at 8
8*8=64 >=54 ✔
c=8 >= r=8 ✔
c-r=0 <=1 ✔
All conditions are satisfied immediately

This matches the example, which is good.

This implementation should now work correctly. Let's proceed.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in crypto_square.h crypto_square.cpp to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests are expecting a `cipher` class with a `normalized_cipher_text()` method, but we implemented a standalone function `cipher_text()`. Let's fix this by implementing a class instead.

Here are the necessary changes:

crypto_square.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CRYPTO_SQUARE_H)
#define CRYPTO_SQUARE_H

#include <string>

namespace crypto_square {

std::string cipher_text(const std::string& text);

    std::string normalized_cipher_text() const;

    std::string normalized_;
    std::size_t c_{0};
    std::size_t r_{0};

    std::string normalized;
    for (char ch : text) {
        if (std::isalnum(static_cast<unsigned char>(ch))) {
            normalized += std::tolower(static_cast<unsigned char>(ch));
        }
    }
    
    // Handle empty input after normalization
    if (normalized.empty()) {

    }
    
    // Determine the number of columns (c) and rows (r)

        } else {
            r++;
        }
    }
    
    // Pad the string with spaces to make its length equal to r * c
    normalized.append(r * c - length, ' ');
    
    // Build the encoded text by reading down the columns
    std::vector<std::string> chunks;
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < c; i++) {

This implementation now uses a class `cipher` with a constructor that takes the input text and a member function `normalized_cipher_text()` that returns the encoded string. This should match what the tests expect.

Key points:
1. The normalization is done in the constructor
2. The number of columns and rows are calculated based on the normalized text length
3. The `normalized_cipher_text()` method processes the normalized text to produce the encoded output
4. We handle the empty string case appropriately

This should now pass the tests that are calling:
```cpp
crypto_square::cipher("input text").normalized_cipher_text()
```

Key changes made:
1. Added `#include <cstdint>` to use fixed-width integer types
2. Changed `std::size_t` to `std::uint32_t` for `c_` and `r_`
3. Added explicit casts where necessary to ensure type consistency
4. Combined conditions in the while loop to be more concise
5. Used `std::uint32_t` for loop counters to match the types of `c_` and `r_`
6. Added a cast when comparing `i` to `chunks.size()` to ensure type consistency

These changes should now comply with the MISRA C++ rules while maintaining the functionality of the implementation. The code should now properly handle the encoding according to the square cipher specifications.

Key improvements made:
1. Added explicit variable for `sqrt_length` to make the calculation clearer
2. Used `const std::uint32_t product` to store the result of `r_ * c_` to avoid repeated calculations
3. Used proper addition with `c_ = c_ + 1` instead of `c_++` to be more explicit
4. Added a check before appending spaces to ensure we don't append if not needed
5. Used `const std::uint32_t index` to calculate the index into the padded string
6. Made sure all operations are type-consistent

This implementation should now properly handle:
1. Normalizing the input text by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase
2. Determining the appropriate number of columns and rows that meet the given conditions
3. Padding the normalized text with spaces to fill the rectangle
4. Reading down the columns to generate the encoded text
5. Formatting the output with spaces between chunks

However, there's a potential issue: when `normalized_` is empty, we need to make sure `c_` and `r_` are handled correctly. Since they're initialized to 0, and we don't enter the adjustment loop when `normalized_.empty()` is true, this should be fine.

This implementation should now pass the tests and comply with the provided MISRA C++ rules. Let's hope this resolves any issues.
