#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Every month, your partner meets up with their best friend.  
#### Both of them have very busy schedules, making it challenging to find a suitable date!  
#### Given your own busy schedule, your partner always double-checks potential meetup dates with you:  
####   
#### - "Can I meet up on the first Friday of next month?"  
#### - "What about the third Wednesday?"  
#### - "Maybe the last Sunday?"  
####   
#### In this month's call, your partner asked you this question:  
####   
#### - "I'd like to meet up on the teenth Thursday; is that okay?"  
####   
#### Confused, you ask what a "teenth" day is.  
#### Your partner explains that a teenth day, a concept they made up, refers to the days in a month that end in '-teenth':  
####   
#### - 13th (thirteenth)  
#### - 14th (fourteenth)  
#### - 15th (fifteenth)  
#### - 16th (sixteenth)  
#### - 17th (seventeenth)  
#### - 18th (eighteenth)  
#### - 19th (nineteenth)  
####   
#### As there are also seven weekdays, it is guaranteed that each day of the week has _exactly one_ teenth day each month.  
####   
#### Now that you understand the concept of a teenth day, you check your calendar.  
#### You don't have anything planned on the teenth Thursday, so you happily confirm the date with your partner.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to find the exact date of a meetup, given a month, year, weekday and week.  
####   
#### There are five week values to consider: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, `last`, `teenth`.  
####   
#### For example, you might be asked to find the date for the meetup on the first Monday in January 2018 (January 1, 2018).  
####   
#### Similarly, you might be asked to find:  
####   
#### - the third Tuesday of August 2019 (August 20, 2019)  
#### - the teenth Wednesday of May 2020 (May 13, 2020)  
#### - the fourth Sunday of July 2021 (July 25, 2021)  
#### - the last Thursday of November 2022 (November 24, 2022)  
#### - the teenth Saturday of August 1953 (August 15, 1953)  
####   
#### ## Teenth  
####   
#### The teenth week refers to the seven days in a month that end in '-teenth' (13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th).  
####   
#### If asked to find the teenth Saturday of August, 1953, we check its calendar:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
####     August 1953  
#### Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
####                    1  
####  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  
####  9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
#### 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  
#### 23 24 25 26 27 28 29  
#### 30 31  
#### ```  
####   
#### From this we find that the teenth Saturday is August 15, 1953.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: meetup.h meetup.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in meetup.h meetup.cpp to resolve the errors.  

To implement the missing API correctly and be sure we use the _exact_ return-type the tests expect, I need to see the test source that drives those calls (e.g. `monteenth()`, `first_monday()`, etc.).

Please add the file that contains the tests – its full path is most likely

meetup/meetup_test.cpp

(or whatever path CMake shows for it).

Once I can inspect that file, I’ll supply the precise SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to fix `meetup.h` and `meetup.cpp`.
