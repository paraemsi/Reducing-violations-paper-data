#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Every month, your partner meets up with their best friend.  
#### Both of them have very busy schedules, making it challenging to find a suitable date!  
#### Given your own busy schedule, your partner always double-checks potential meetup dates with you:  
####   
#### - "Can I meet up on the first Friday of next month?"  
#### - "What about the third Wednesday?"  
#### - "Maybe the last Sunday?"  
####   
#### In this month's call, your partner asked you this question:  
####   
#### - "I'd like to meet up on the teenth Thursday; is that okay?"  
####   
#### Confused, you ask what a "teenth" day is.  
#### Your partner explains that a teenth day, a concept they made up, refers to the days in a month that end in '-teenth':  
####   
#### - 13th (thirteenth)  
#### - 14th (fourteenth)  
#### - 15th (fifteenth)  
#### - 16th (sixteenth)  
#### - 17th (seventeenth)  
#### - 18th (eighteenth)  
#### - 19th (nineteenth)  
####   
#### As there are also seven weekdays, it is guaranteed that each day of the week has _exactly one_ teenth day each month.  
####   
#### Now that you understand the concept of a teenth day, you check your calendar.  
#### You don't have anything planned on the teenth Thursday, so you happily confirm the date with your partner.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to find the exact date of a meetup, given a month, year, weekday and week.  
####   
#### There are five week values to consider: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, `last`, `teenth`.  
####   
#### For example, you might be asked to find the date for the meetup on the first Monday in January 2018 (January 1, 2018).  
####   
#### Similarly, you might be asked to find:  
####   
#### - the third Tuesday of August 2019 (August 20, 2019)  
#### - the teenth Wednesday of May 2020 (May 13, 2020)  
#### - the fourth Sunday of July 2021 (July 25, 2021)  
#### - the last Thursday of November 2022 (November 24, 2022)  
#### - the teenth Saturday of August 1953 (August 15, 1953)  
####   
#### ## Teenth  
####   
#### The teenth week refers to the seven days in a month that end in '-teenth' (13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th).  
####   
#### If asked to find the teenth Saturday of August, 1953, we check its calendar:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
####     August 1953  
#### Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
####                    1  
####  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  
####  9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
#### 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  
#### 23 24 25 26 27 28 29  
#### 30 31  
#### ```  
####   
#### From this we find that the teenth Saturday is August 15, 1953.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: meetup.h meetup.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. We need to implement a function to find the exact date for a meetup based on the given month, year, weekday, and week specification. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the files provided are empty, we need to define the interface first. Let's assume we need a class or function that can handle this. The instructions mention not to change existing function names, but since they're empty, we need to define them.

Typically, such problems would have a function that takes year, month, weekday, and week descriptor, and returns a date (probably using boost::gregorian or similar, but since we're to use standard libraries, we'll need to implement date logic ourselves).

However, C++20 introduced the `<chrono>` calendar additions, but they might not be available everywhere. Let's implement it using basic date calculations.

Wait, the year could be from the past, so we need to be careful about leap years, etc.

Let's define the interface first. Let's have a function that takes these parameters and returns a struct containing day, month, year.

Wait, the header file suggests a namespace, so we'll put our implementation there.

Here's a plan:
1. Parse the week descriptor to understand which days to consider
2. For each candidate day in the month, check if it matches the weekday
3. Track which occurrence we're at to find the right one

Let's implement:

Wait, first let's define the interface in the header:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

namespace meetup {

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
=======
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>

namespace meetup {

class scheduler {
public:
    scheduler(int year, int month);
    boost::gregorian::date meetup_day(int week, int weekday) const;
private:
    int year_;
    int month_;
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

But the instructions say to use standard libraries, and boost is not standard. Let's implement without external libraries.

Wait, this is tricky. Let's implement our own date calculation:
1. Use Zeller's congruence to find the day of the week for any date
2. Find all relevant days in the month that match the weekday
3. Pick the appropriate one based on the week descriptor

Let's implement:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

namespace meetup {

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
=======
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

namespace meetup {

struct Date {
    std::int32_t year;
    std::int32_t month;
    std::int32_t day;
};

class scheduler {
public:
    scheduler(std::int32_t year, std::int32_t month);
    Date meetup_day(const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday) const;
private:
    std::int32_t year_;
    std::int32_t month_;
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "meetup.h"

#include "meetup.h"
#include <cstdint>

    if (month < 3) {
        month += 12;
        year -= 1;
    }
    std::int32_t k = year % 100;
    std::int32_t j = year / 100;
    std::int32_t h = (day + (13 * (month + 1)) / 5 + k + (k / 4) + (j / 4) + (5 * j)) % 7;
    // Convert to day where 0=Saturday, 1=Sunday, ... 6=Friday
    return ((h + 5) % 7);
}

std::int32_t weekday_to_int(const std::string& weekday) {
    if (weekday == "Monday") return 1;
    if (weekday == "Tuesday") return 2;
    if (weekday == "Wednesday") return 3;

    static const std::array<std::int32_t, 13> days_in_month = {
        0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31
    };
    
    std::int32_t days = days_in_month[month];
    // Check for leap year (February)
    if ((month == 2) && (year % 4 == 0)) {
        if ((year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)) {
            days = 29;
        }
    }
    std::vector<std::int32_t> result;
    for (std::int32_t day = 1; day <= days; ++day) {
        result.push_back(day);
    }
    return result;
}

}  // namespace

    : year_(year), month_(month) {
}

Date scheduler::meetup_day(const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday) const {
    std::int32_t target_weekday = weekday_to_int(weekday);
    auto days = get_days_in_month(year_, month_);
    std::vector<std::int32_t> matching_days;
    
    for (auto day : days) {
        if (zeller(year_, month_, day) == target_weekday) {
            matching_days.push_back(day);
        }
    }
    
    if (week == "first") {
        return Date{year_, month_, matching_days[0]};
    } else if (week == "second") {
        return Date{year_, month_, matching_days[1]};
    } else if (week == "third") {
        return Date{year_, month_, matching_days[2]};
    } else if (week == "fourth") {
        return Date{year_, month_, matching_days[3]};
    } else if (week == "last") {
        return Date{year_, month_, matching_days.back()};
    } else if (week == "teenth") {
        for (auto day : matching_days) {
            if (day >= 13 && day <= 19) {
                return Date{year_, month_, day};
            }
        }
    }
    throw std::runtime_error("Invalid week specification");
}

}  // namespace meetup
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation uses Zeller's congruence to find the day of the week, which should work correctly. Let's test the provided examples:
- First Monday in January 2018: January 1, 2018
- Third Tuesday of August 2019: August 20, 2019
- Teenth Wednesday of May 2020: May 13, 2020
- Fourth Sunday of July 2021: July 25, 2021
- Last Thursday of November 2022: November 24, 2022
- Teenth Saturday of August 1953: August 15, 1953

Note: The implementation uses 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc. which matches the conversion in weekday_to_int().

This implementation should work, but we need to be careful about edge cases. Let's proceed.

# The other 2 SEARCH/REPLACE blocks were applied successfully.
Don't re-send them.
Just reply with fixed versions of the block above that failed to match.  

I understand. Let's fix the header to match the implementation. Since the implementation uses a Date struct and takes strings for week and weekday, we need to update the header accordingly.

Here's the fixed *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>

namespace meetup {

class scheduler {

    scheduler(int year, int month);
    boost::gregorian::date meetup_day(int week, int weekday) const;
private:
    int year_;
    int month_;
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H

#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

namespace meetup {

struct Date {

    std::int32_t month;
    std::int32_t day;
};

class scheduler {

    scheduler(std::int32_t year, std::int32_t month);
    Date meetup_day(const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday) const;
private:
    std::int32_t year_;
    std::int32_t month_;
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a slight issue: the implementation uses `std::int32_t` but the original header used `int`. Let's make sure to use fixed-width types consistently. Also, the implementation expects week and weekday to be strings, which matches our changes.

This should now be consistent with the implementation in meetup.cpp. Let's also make sure to include all necessary headers.

I understand. The issue is that we need to include the `<string>` header to use `std::string`. Let's fix that.

Here's the necessary change:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

namespace meetup {

struct Date {
    std::int32_t year;
    std::int32_t month;
    std::int32_t day;
};

class scheduler {
public:
    scheduler(std::int32_t year, std::int32_t month);
    Date meetup_day(const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday) const;
private:
    std::int32_t year_;
    std::int32_t month_;
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
=======
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

namespace meetup {

struct Date {
    std::int32_t year;
    std::int32_t month;
    std::int32_t day;
};

class scheduler {
public:
    scheduler(std::int32_t year, std::int32_t month);
    Date meetup_day(const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday) const;
private:
    std::int32_t year_;
    std::int32_t month_;
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Wait, the change is the same. The issue might be that the `<string>` header is already included, but perhaps there's another issue. Let's check if there are any other problems.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. The error markers are pointing to lines that use `std::int32_t` which is from `<cstdint>`, and `std::string` which is from `<string>`, both of which are included.

Perhaps the issue is that the implementation needs to be adjusted to follow the MISRA C++ rules mentioned earlier. Let's review the implementation:

1. All integer types should use fixed-width types (which they do)
2. Parentheses should be used appropriately in expressions
3. if/else bodies should be compound statements
4. No numerical values of characters should be used

Let's fix any potential issues in the implementation:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH

        year -= 1;
    }
    std::int32_t k = year % 100;
    std::int32_t j = year / 100;
    std::int32_t h = (day + (13 * (month + 1)) / 5 + k + (k / 4) + (j / 4) + (5 * j)) % 7;
    // Convert to day where 0=Saturday, 1=Sunday, ... 6=Friday

These changes ensure that:
1. The arithmetic expression in zeller's congruence is properly parenthesized
2. The condition in the teenth check uses parentheses around each relational expression before combining them with &&
3. All if/else bodies are compound statements (which they already were)

This should now comply with the MISRA C++ rules provided. Let's hope this resolves any issues.

I understand. The issue is that the implementation needs to be adjusted to follow the MISRA C++ rules, particularly regarding the use of integer types and ensuring all if statements have compound bodies. Let's fix the implementation.

However, the implementation looks correct. Let's check if there are any issues with the leap year calculation or other parts.

Wait, the leap year calculation needs to be fixed to use proper parentheses:
(year % 4 == 0) && ((year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0))

Also, we need to ensure all if statements have compound bodies, which they do.

Here are the necessary fixes:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    std::int32_t days = days_in_month[month];
    // Check for leap year (February)
    if ((month == 2) && (year % 4 == 0)) {
        if ((year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)) {
            days = 29;
        }
    }
=======
    std::int32_t days = days_in_month[month];
    // Check for leap year (February)
    if (month == 2) {
        if (((year % 4) == 0) && (((year % 100) != 0) || ((year % 400) == 0))) {
            days = 29;
        }
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Also, we need to ensure all conditions are properly parenthesized:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    for (auto day : days) {
        if (zeller(year_, month_, day) == target_weekday) {
            matching_days.push_back(day);
        }
    }
=======
    for (auto day : days) {
        if ((zeller(year_, month_, day) == target_weekday)) {
            matching_days.push_back(day);
        }
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that:
1. All conditions are properly parenthesized according to MISRA rules
2. The leap year condition is correct and properly parenthesized
3. All if statements have compound bodies

This should now comply with the MISRA C++ rules. Let's hope this resolves any issues.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in meetup.h meetup.cpp to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests expect specific member functions like `monteenth()`, `tuesteenth()`, etc. which our implementation doesn't provide. We need to add these functions to the `scheduler` class.

Let's modify the implementation to include these functions. Each function will correspond to finding the teenth day for a specific weekday, or the first, second, etc. day of the month for a specific weekday.

Here are the necessary changes:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH

#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

namespace meetup {

struct Date {
    std::int32_t year;

    std::int32_t day;
};

class scheduler {
public:
    scheduler(std::int32_t year, std::int32_t month);
    Date meetup_day(const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday) const;

This implementation uses macros to generate all the required member functions, which should now match what the tests expect. Let's hope this resolves the compilation errors.

I see the issue. The macros are not being used correctly, and we need to include the `<unordered_map>` header. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "meetup.h"
#include <cstdint>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <functional>
#include <stdexcept>

#include <vector>
#include <functional>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <array>
#include <unordered_map>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's fix the macro usage. The issue is that the macro parameters aren't being used correctly. Let's reimplement them properly:
