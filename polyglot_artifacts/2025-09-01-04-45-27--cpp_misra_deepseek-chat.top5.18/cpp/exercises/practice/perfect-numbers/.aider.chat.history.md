#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of [perfect](#perfect), [abundant](#abundant), or [deficient](#deficient) based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The _aliquot sum_ is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of `15` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.  
####   
#### ## Perfect  
####   
#### A number is perfect when it equals its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `6` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`  
#### - `28` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`  
####   
#### ## Abundant  
####   
#### A number is abundant when it is less than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `12` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
#### - `24` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36`  
####   
#### ## Deficient  
####   
#### A number is deficient when it is greater than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `8` is a deficient number because `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`  
#### - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is [perfect](#perfect).  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is [abundant](#abundant) or [deficient](#deficient).

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: perfect_numbers.cpp perfect_numbers.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a classification for numbers based on their aliquot sum. Let's think through this carefully.

Since we're dealing with positive integers, we need to find all proper divisors of a number (excluding the number itself) and sum them up. Then, we can compare this sum to the original number to classify it.

However, the instructions mention that we need to determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient. Let's implement a function that returns the classification.

Since the files provided are empty, I'll need to add the implementation. Let's add a function to the namespace that takes an integer and returns its classification.

Wait, the instructions say to use fixed-width integer types, so we'll include <cstdint> and use appropriate types.

Here's the plan:
1. Include necessary headers
2. Implement a function to calculate the aliquot sum
3. Compare the aliquot sum to the number to determine classification
4. Return an appropriate enum or string

Since the instructions don't specify the exact return type, and looking at typical implementations, it's common to return an enum or a string. Let's use a string to match the classification names.

Here are the necessary changes:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <string>

namespace perfect_numbers {
    std::string classify(int num);
}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in perfect_numbers.cpp:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {
    std::string classify(int num) {
        if (num <= 0) {
            throw std::domain_error("Classification is only possible for positive integers.");
        }
        
        // Handle 1 as a special case (its only proper divisor is 0)
        if (num == 1) {
            return "deficient";
        }
        
        int sum = 1; // 1 is a proper divisor for all numbers > 1
        for (int i = 2; i <= std::sqrt(num); i++) {
            if ((num % i) == 0) {
                int other = num / i;
                if (i == other) {
                    sum += i;
                } else {
                    sum += i + other;
                }
            }
        }
        
        if (sum == num) {
            return "perfect";
        } else if (sum > num) {
            return "abundant";
        } else {
            return "deficient";
        }
    }
}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to ensure that the number is positive, so we throw an exception if it's not
2. We need to find all proper divisors efficiently by iterating up to the square root
3. We need to handle the case where the number is 1 separately
4. We need to make sure we're not including the number itself in the sum

Wait, the aliquot sum is the sum of proper divisors, which excludes the number itself. So for num=6, proper divisors are 1, 2, 3 which sum to 6, which matches num, so it's perfect.

This implementation should work, but let's test it with some examples:
- 6: divisors are 1, 2, 3 → sum=6 → perfect
- 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 → sum=28 → perfect
- 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → sum=16 > 12 → abundant
- 8: 1, 2, 4 → sum=7 < 8 → deficient
- 1: no proper divisors → sum=0 < 1 → deficient

This matches our expectations.

However, the implementation needs to be efficient, especially for large numbers. The square root approach is efficient.

This implementation should work. Let's proceed.

I understand. We need to use fixed-width integer types according to the MISRA C++ rules provided. Let's fix that.

Since the function parameter and return types need to use appropriate types, and we're dealing with positive integers, we should use a fixed-width integer type. Let's use `std::int32_t` which is appropriate for most cases.

However, the function signature needs to be updated to use fixed-width types. Also, we need to include `<cstdint>`.

Here are the necessary fixes:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <string>

namespace perfect_numbers {
    std::string classify(int num);
}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <string>
#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {
    std::string classify(std::int32_t num);
}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, we need to update the implementation to use fixed-width integer types as well:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {
    std::string classify(int num) {
        if (num <= 0) {
            throw std::domain_error("Classification is only possible for positive integers.");
        }
        
        // Handle 1 as a special case (its only proper divisor is 0)
        if (num == 1) {
            return "deficient";
        }
        
        int sum = 1; // 1 is a proper divisor for all numbers > 1
        for (int i = 2; i <= std::sqrt(num); i++) {
            if ((num % i) == 0) {
                int other = num / i;
                if (i == other) {
                    sum += i;
                } else {
                    sum += i + other;
                }
            }
        }
        
        if (sum == num) {
            return "perfect";
        } else if (sum > num) {
            return "abundant";
        } else {
            return "deficient";
        }
    }
}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {
    std::string classify(std::int32_t num) {
        if (num <= 0) {
            throw std::domain_error("Classification is only possible for positive integers.");
        }
        
        // Handle 1 as a special case (its only proper divisor is 0)
        if (num == 1) {
            return "deficient";
        }
        
        std::int32_t sum = 1; // 1 is a proper divisor for all numbers > 1
        for (std::int32_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int32_t>(std::sqrt(num)); i++) {
            if ((num % i) == 0) {
                std::int32_t other = num / i;
                if (i == other) {
                    sum += i;
                } else {
                    sum += i + other;
                }
            }
        }
        
        if (sum == num) {
            return "perfect";
        } else if (sum > num) {
            return "abundant";
        } else {
            return "deficient";
        }
    }
}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to cast the result of `std::sqrt(num)` to `std::int32_t` to avoid mixing floating point and integer types
2. All integer types are now using fixed-width types
3. The implementation remains the same, just with type changes

This should now comply with the MISRA C++ rules:
1. No use of standard integer types like `int`
2. Using fixed-width integer types from `<cstdint>`
3. All variables are appropriately typed

Let's test our implementation with some examples:
- classify(6) → aliquot sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 → "perfect"
- classify(28) → 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28 → "perfect"
- classify(12) → 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 → "abundant"
- classify(8) → 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 → "deficient"
- classify(1) → 0 → "deficient"

This implementation should work correctly. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle all cases correctly, especially when dealing with integer types and ensuring proper comparisons. Let's fix the implementation.

The issue might be with integer overflow or not handling certain cases correctly. Let's make sure:
1. We're not including the number itself in the sum
2. We're handling edge cases properly
3. We're using proper types to prevent overflow

Wait, the aliquot sum is the sum of proper divisors, which are all divisors except the number itself. So for num=1, there are no proper divisors, so the sum is 0, which is less than 1 → deficient

However, the implementation needs to be precise. Let's fix it:

Here's a revised approach:
1. Always start sum at 0
2. Find all divisors up to num/2
3. Add them to the sum
4. Compare sum to num

This is less efficient but more straightforward.

Wait, but for large numbers, this could be too slow. Let's stick with the optimized approach but fix any issues.

Here are the necessary fixes:

```

However, there's an issue: when i=1, other would be num/1=num, which we need to exclude from the sum. So we need to make sure we're not adding the number itself to the sum.

Wait, the aliquot sum should only include proper divisors, which are all divisors except the number itself. So we need to ensure that:
1. We never add 'num' to the sum
2. All other divisors are added

This implementation ensures that:
1. For i=1, we add i=1, but check if other=num/1=num is not equal to i and not equal to num
   Since other == num, and other != i (unless num == 1, which we handled), we won't add 'num' to the sum
2. For other divisors, we add both i and other, making sure other != num

Let's test this approach:
- num=6: i=1 → add 1, other=6 → don't add (6 !=1 && 6 !=6 → second condition fails)
  i=2 → add 2, other=3 → add 3
  i=3 → same as i=2
  Sum: 1 + 2 + 3 =6 → perfect
- num=28: similar logic
- num=1: handled separately → sum=0 → 0<1 → deficient

This seems correct. Let's proceed with this implementation.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in perfect_numbers.cpp perfect_numbers.h to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests expect an enum type `classification` to be defined, but our implementation returns a string. Let's fix that.

We need to define an enum `classification` in the header and have `classify` return that enum type instead of a string.

Here are the necessary changes:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <string>
#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {
    std::string classify(std::int32_t num);
}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int32_t num);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, we need to update the implementation to return the enum values:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {
    std::string classify(std::int32_t num) {
        if (num <= 0) {
            throw std::domain_error("Classification is only possible for positive integers.");
        }
        
        // Handle 1 as a special case - no proper divisors
        if (num == 1) {
            return "deficient";
        }
        
        std::int32_t sum = 0;
        for (std::int32_t i = 1; i <= static_cast<std::int32_t>(std::sqrt(num)); i++) {
            if ((num % i) == 0) {
                // Add the divisor
                sum += i;
                // Add the corresponding divisor, if it's different and not the number itself
                std::int32_t other = num / i;
                if ((other != i) && (other != num)) {
                    sum += other;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Now compare the sum to the number
        if (sum == num) {
            return "perfect";
        } else if (sum > num) {
            return "abundant";
        } else {
            return "deficient";
        }
    }
}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {
    classification classify(std::int32_t num) {
        if (num <= 0) {
            throw std::domain_error("Classification is only possible for positive integers.");
        }
        
        // Handle 1 as a special case - no proper divisors
        if (num == 1) {
            return classification::deficient;
        }
        
        std::int32_t sum = 0;
        for (std::int32_t i = 1; i <= static_cast<std::int32_t>(std::sqrt(num)); i++) {
            if ((num % i) == 0) {
                // Add the divisor
                sum += i;
                // Add the corresponding divisor, if it's different and not the number itself
                std::int32_t other = num / i;
                if ((other != i) && (other != num)) {
                    sum += other;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Now compare the sum to the number
        if (sum == num) {
            return classification::perfect;
        } else if (sum > num) {
            return classification::abundant;
        } else {
            return classification::deficient;
        }
    }
}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation now matches what the tests expect:
1. It uses an enum class `classification` with values `perfect`, `abundant`, and `deficient`
2. The `classify` function returns this enum type instead of a string
3. All other logic remains the same

This should now compile and pass the tests:
- For num=6: sum=1+2+3=6 → classification::perfect
- For num=28: sum=1+2+4+7+14=28 → classification::perfect
- For num=12: sum=1+2+3+4+6=16 → classification::abundant
- For num=8: sum=1+2+4=7 → classification::deficient
- For num=1: sum=0 → classification::deficient

Let's hope this resolves the compilation errors.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to properly calculate the aliquot sum. The issue is that we're adding divisors incorrectly. Let's fix that.

The aliquot sum is the sum of all proper divisors (divisors excluding the number itself). So for a number `num`, we need to find all divisors that are less than `num` and sum them up.

Here's a revised approach:
1. Iterate up to num/2 to find all divisors
2. Sum all divisors that evenly divide num and are less than num
3. Compare the sum to num to determine the classification

This is more straightforward and ensures we're only including proper divisors.

Here are the necessary fixes:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp

#include <cmath>
#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {
    classification classify(std::int32_t num) {

            throw std::domain_error("Classification is only possible for positive integers.");
        }
        
        // Handle 1 as a special case - no proper divisors
        if (num == 1) {
            return classification::deficient;
        }
        
        std::int32_t sum = 0;
        for (std::int32_t i = 1; i <= static_cast<std::int32_t>(std::sqrt(num)); i++) {
            if ((num % i) == 0) {
                // Add the divisor
                sum += i;
                // Add the corresponding divisor, if it's different and not the number itself
                std::int32_t other = num / i;
                if ((other != i) && (other != num)) {
                    sum += other;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Now compare the sum to the number
        if (sum == num) {
            return classification::perfect;
        } else if (sum > num) {
            return classification::abundant;
        } else {
            return classification::deficient;
        }
    }
}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {
    classification classify(std::int32_t num) {
        if (num <= 0) {
            throw std::domain_error("Classification is only possible for positive integers.");
        }
        
        // Calculate the sum of proper divisors
        std::int32_t sum = 0;
        for (std::int32_t i = 1; i <= (num / 2); i++) {
            if ((num % i) == 0) {
                sum += i;
            }
        }
        
        // Compare the sum to the number to determine classification
        if (sum == num) {
            return classification::perfect;
        } else if (sum > num) {
            return classification::abundant;
        } else {
            return classification::deficient;
        }
    }

```

This implementation is more straightforward:
1. We only consider divisors up to num/2, as no proper divisor can be larger than num/2 (except num itself, which we're excluding)
2. We sum all divisors that evenly divide num
3. We compare the sum to num to determine the classification

Let's test this approach:
- num=6: divisors are 1, 2, 3 → sum=6 → perfect
- num=28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 → sum=28 → perfect
- num=12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → sum=16 > 12 → abundant
- num=8: 1, 2, 4 → sum=7 < 8 → deficient
- num=1: no divisors in loop (i <= 0.5) → sum=0 < 1 → deficient

This matches our expectations and should now work correctly with the tests.
