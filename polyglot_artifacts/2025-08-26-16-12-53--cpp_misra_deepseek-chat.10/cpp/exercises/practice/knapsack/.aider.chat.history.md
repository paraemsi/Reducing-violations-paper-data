#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a fancy store.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value and weight.  
#### Bob would gladly take all of the items, but his knapsack can only hold so much weight.  
#### Bob has to carefully consider which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to determine which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized, taking into account the knapsack's carrying capacity.  
####   
#### Items will be represented as a list of items.  
#### Each item will have a weight and value.  
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10  
#### ```  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.h knapsack.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a solution to the classic 0/1 knapsack problem. Since Bob can only take one of each item, and we need to maximize the total value without exceeding the maximum weight, we can use dynamic programming.

Since the weights can be up to a certain maximum, and the number of items can be large, we need an efficient approach. Let's use a dynamic programming approach where dp[i] represents the maximum value achievable with weight i.

However, to use fixed-width types, we need to include <cstdint> and use appropriate types.

Let's implement this:

1. First, update the header to include necessary types
2. Implement the function to solve the knapsack problem

Wait, the instructions don't specify a function signature, but since it's a namespace, we need to add a function to the namespace.
Let's assume we need to add a function that takes a list of items and maximum weight, and returns the maximum value.

Here are the necessary changes:

First, update the header to include the function declaration:

knapsack.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    int weight;
    int value;
};

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
=======
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    std::int32_t weight;
    std::int32_t value;
};

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items);

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, implement the function in the cpp file:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"

namespace knapsack
{

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty())
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i] is the maximum value with weight i
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process from the end
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    // Since dp[w] always stores the maximum value for weight w, the last element may not be the maximum
    // So we need to find the maximum value in the entire dp array
    std::int32_t max_value = 0;
    for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximum_weight; ++w)
    {
        if (dp[w] > max_value)
        {
            max_value = dp[w];
        }
    }
    
    return max_value;
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation uses dynamic programming where dp[w] represents the maximum value that can be achieved with weight w. We process each item and update the dp array from the maximum weight down to the item's weight to ensure each item is only used once.

However, there are a few things to note:
1. All values are positive, so initializing dp with 0 is appropriate
2. We need to process weights in reverse to avoid reusing the same item multiple times
3. The maximum value may not be at dp[maximum_weight], so we need to find the maximum value in the dp array

This implementation should work efficiently within the constraints. Let's test it with the provided example:
Items: [
  { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },
  { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }
]
Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10

Processing:
- For item 1 (5, 10): Update weights 10-5
- For item 2 (4, 40): Update weights 10-4
- etc.

The maximum value should be 90 (items 2 and 4: 4 + 4 = 8 <= 10, value 40 + 50 = 90)

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle cases where the maximum weight is 0, and to ensure it always works correctly. Let's also make sure to use appropriate types and follow the rules.

However, the implementation seems correct, but there might be an issue when maximum_weight is 0. Let's test:
- If maximum_weight is 0, then no items can be selected, so the maximum value should be 0
- The implementation already handles empty items by returning 0

Wait, but if maximum_weight is 0, the dp vector will have size 1 (indices 0..0)
The loop for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w) may not run if item.weight > 0, which is always true since weights are positive
So it's fine

But to be precise, we can add a check at the beginning:
if (maximum_weight == 0) return 0;

Wait, the implementation already handles this because dp will be a vector of size 1 with value 0, and the max_value will be 0

However, to follow the rules, we need to ensure all types are appropriate and operations are correct:
1. All types are std::int32_t which is good
2. We need to add parentheses to expressions to follow operator precedence rules

Let's fix the implementation:

Here are the necessary changes:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty())
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i] is the maximum value with weight i
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process from the end
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    // Since dp[w] always stores the maximum value for weight w, the last element may not be the maximum
    // So we need to find the maximum value in the entire dp array
    std::int32_t max_value = 0;
    for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximum_weight; ++w)
    {
        if (dp[w] > max_value)
        {
            max_value = dp[w];
        }
    }
    
    return max_value;
}

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if ((items.empty()) || (maximum_weight == 0))
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i] is the maximum value with weight i
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(static_cast<std::size_t>(maximum_weight) + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process from the end
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            std::int32_t const new_value = dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w) - static_cast<std::size_t>(item.weight)] + item.value;
            if (dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)] < new_value)
            {
                dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)] = new_value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array

    {

        {
            max_value = dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)];
        }
    }
    
    return max_value;
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. Added explicit check for maximum_weight == 0
2. Added explicit casting to std::size_t for vector indices to prevent potential issues
3. Added parentheses around conditions to follow operator precedence rules
4. Split the comparison into a separate variable to make it clearer

This implementation should now follow the rules:
- All types are appropriate (std::int32_t)
- Parentheses are used where necessary
- No mixing of types in assignments
- All vector accesses use std::size_t which is appropriate

However, the implementation may need to be tested with various cases:
1. Empty items list
2. Maximum weight is 0
3. Regular cases
4. Cases where items have weight larger than maximum_weight (the inner loop condition w >= item.weight handles this)

This should now work correctly. Let's test with the provided example:
Items: weight 5, value 10; weight 4, value 40; weight 6, value 30; weight 4, value 50
Maximum weight: 10

The maximum value should be 90 (items with weight 4 and 4: 40 + 50 = 90)
