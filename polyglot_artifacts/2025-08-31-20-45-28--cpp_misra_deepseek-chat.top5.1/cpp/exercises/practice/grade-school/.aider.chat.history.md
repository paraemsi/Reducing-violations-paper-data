#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.  
####   
#### In the end, you should be able to:  
####   
#### - Add a student's name to the roster for a grade  
####   - "Add Jim to grade 2."  
####   - "OK."  
#### - Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade  
####   - "Which students are in grade 2?"  
####   - "We've only got Jim just now."  
#### - Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  
####   Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.  
####   - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"  
####   - "Let me think.  
####     We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.  
####     So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"  
####   
#### Note that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.  
#### In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grade_school.h grade_school.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a school roster system that can add students to grades and retrieve them in a sorted manner. Let's break this down:

1. We need a data structure to store students per grade
2. Each grade should have a list of student names
3. When adding a student, we need to check if they're already in the grade
4. The roster should always be sorted by grade, and students within each grade should be sorted alphabetically
5. We need to be able to get students for a specific grade, and all students across all grades

Since we're working in C++, we'll use a map where the key is the grade number and the value is a vector of names.
We'll need to sort the names when adding them and keep them sorted.

However, the instructions mention that adding the same student more than once to a grade or roster should be considered incorrect.
Since all students only have one name, we can use the name to check for uniqueness within a grade.

Let's implement this:

First, we need to update the header file to declare the class and its methods:

grade_school.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(GRADE_SCHOOL_H)
#define GRADE_SCHOOL_H

namespace grade_school {

}  // namespace grade_school

#endif // GRADE_SCHOOL_H
=======
#if !defined(GRADE_SCHOOL_H)
#define GRADE_SCHOOL_H

#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

namespace grade_school {

class school {
private:
    std::map<int, std::vector<std::string>> roster_;
public:
    school() = default;
    
    // Add a student to a grade
    void add(const std::string& name, int grade);
    
    // Get all students in a grade, sorted alphabetically
    std::vector<std::string> grade(int grade_num) const;
    
    // Get the complete school roster, sorted by grade and then by name
    std::map<int, std::vector<std::string>> roster() const;
};

}  // namespace grade_school

#endif // GRADE_SCHOOL_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these methods in the cpp file:

grade_school.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "grade_school.h"

namespace grade_school {

}  // namespace grade_school
=======
#include "grade_school.h"
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace grade_school {

void school::add(const std::string& name, int grade) {
    // Check if the student already exists in any grade
    // But according to the note, each student can't be added more than once to the roster
    // So we need to check all grades
    for (const auto& entry : roster_) {
        const auto& students = entry.second;
        if (std::find(students.begin(), students.end(), name) != students.end()) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Student already exists in the roster");
        }
    }
    
    // Add to the appropriate grade
    auto& students = roster_[grade];
    // Insert in sorted order
    auto it = std::lower_bound(students.begin(), students.end(), name);
    students.insert(it, name);
}

std::vector<std::string> school::grade(int grade_num) const {
    auto it = roster_.find(grade_num);
    if (it != roster_.end()) {
        return it->second;
    }
    return {};
}

std::map<int, std::vector<std::string>> school::roster() const {
    return roster_;
}

}  // namespace grade_school
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The implementation needs to ensure that when adding a student, if they're already present in any grade, it should throw an exception
2. The roster() method returns a copy, which is fine
3. The grade() method returns a copy of the vector, which is also fine
4. We always keep the students' names sorted when adding them

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
- Adding a student to a grade: add(name, grade)
- Getting all students in a grade: grade(grade_num)
- Getting the complete roster: roster() which returns a map<int, vector<string>> where grades are ordered and students are ordered within each grade

However, the note says "each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster", so we need to check if the student exists in the specific grade being added to, or in any grade? The wording is a bit ambiguous.
The implementation above checks across all grades, which seems to match "the roster" part.

Wait, the implementation throws an exception if the student exists in any grade, which matches "cannot be added more than once to the roster".
This seems correct.

This implementation should work. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to follow the MISRA C++ rules provided. Let's fix the issues:

1. The integer types need to be fixed to use fixed-width types
2. We need to include <cstdint>
3. We need to ensure proper parentheses in expressions
4. We need to ensure if/else statements use compound statements
5. We need to handle character usage appropriately

Wait, the grade numbers are integers, but according to the rules, we shouldn't use 'int' directly.
Let's define a type alias for grade numbers.

Here are the necessary fixes:

grade_school.h
```cpp

    // Add a student to a grade
    void add(const std::string& name, int grade);
    
    // Get all students in a grade, sorted alphabetically
    std::vector<std::string> grade(int grade_num) const;
    
    // Get the complete school roster, sorted by grade and then by name
    std::map<int, std::vector<std::string>> roster() const;
};

}  // namespace grade_school

#endif // GRADE_SCHOOL_H

namespace grade_school {

using grade_t = std::int32_t;

class school {

public:

    // Add a student to a grade
    void add(const std::string& name, grade_t grade);
    
    // Get all students in a grade, sorted alphabetically
    std::vector<std::string> grade(grade_t grade_num) const;
    
    // Get the complete school roster, sorted by grade and then by name
    std::map<grade_t, std::vector<std::string>> roster() const;
};

}  // namespace grade_school

#endif // GRADE_SCHOOL_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's fix the implementation in grade_school.cpp:

grade_school.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "grade_school.h"
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace grade_school {

void school::add(const std::string& name, int grade) {
    // Check if the student already exists in any grade
    // But according to the note, each student can't be added more than once to the roster
    // So we need to check all grades
    for (const auto& entry : roster_) {
        const auto& students = entry.second;
        if (std::find(students.begin(), students.end(), name) != students.end()) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Student already exists in the roster");
        }
    }
    
    // Add to the appropriate grade
    auto& students = roster_[grade];
    // Insert in sorted order
    auto it = std::lower_bound(students.begin(), students.end(), name);
    students.insert(it, name);
}

std::vector<std::string> school::grade(int grade_num) const {
    auto it = roster_.find(grade_num);
    if (it != roster_.end()) {
        return it->second;
    }
    return {};
}

std::map<int, std::vector<std::string>> school::roster() const {
    return roster_;
}

}  // namespace grade_school
=======
#include "grade_school.h"
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace grade_school {

void school::add(const std::string& name, grade_t grade) {
    // Check if the student already exists in any grade
    for (const auto& entry : roster_) {
        const auto& students = entry.second;
        if (std::find(students.begin(), students.end(), name) != students.end()) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Student already exists in the roster");
        }
    }
    
    // Add to the appropriate grade
    auto& students = roster_[grade];
    // Insert in sorted order
    auto it = std::lower_bound(students.begin(), students.end(), name);
    students.insert(it, name);
}

std::vector<std::string> school::grade(grade_t grade_num) const {
    auto it = roster_.find(grade_num);
    if (it != roster_.end()) { 
        return it->second;
    } else { 
        return {};
    }
}

std::map<grade_t, std::vector<std::string>> school::roster() const {
    return roster_;
}

}  // namespace grade_school
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The implementation uses `std::find` which is fine
2. We need to ensure all if/else statements use compound statements, which they do
3. We're using grade_t which is a fixed-width type (std::int32_t)
4. The implementation properly checks for existing students across all grades
5. The roster() method returns a copy, which is correct

This implementation should now follow the provided MISRA C++ rules:
- Using fixed-width integer types through the grade_t alias
- All if/else statements use compound statements
- No direct use of standard integer types
- No issues with character usage (we're only dealing with std::string which is fine)

However, the note says to always parenthesize expressions, but in this implementation, most expressions are simple and don't need additional parentheses. For example:
- `std::find(students.begin(), students.end(), name) != students.end()` is part of an if condition, which is fine
- The conditions are simple and don't mix operators of different precedence levels

This implementation should now be correct. Let me know if there are any further issues.

I understand. The implementation needs to ensure that when adding a student, we only check if they're in the specific grade being added to, not all grades. The note says "each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster", which means:
1. A student can't be in the same grade more than once
2. A student can't be in multiple grades at once

So we need to check:
1. If the student is already in the grade we're trying to add them to
2. If the student exists in any other grade

Let's fix the implementation:

    if (it != roster_.end()) { 
        return it->second;

    }
}

std::map<grade_t, std::vector<std::string>> school::roster() const {
    return roster_;
}

}  // namespace grade_school
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation now properly checks:
1. If the student is already in the target grade (throw an error)
2. If the student is in any other grade (throw an error)
3. Only if neither condition is true, add the student to the grade in sorted order

This ensures that:
- A student can't be added to the same grade more than once
- A student can't be in multiple grades at once
- The roster always maintains the invariant that all students are unique across all grades

However, according to the instructions, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, the implementation should indicate that this is incorrect. Throwing an exception is a valid way to do this.

This implementation should now be correct. Let me know if there are any further issues.
