#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: space_age.cpp space_age.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a class that can calculate someone's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

Since we're working in C++, we'll create a class that takes the age in seconds in its constructor and provides member functions to get the age on each planet.

First, let's define the orbital periods in Earth years:
- Mercury: 0.2408467
- Venus: 0.61519726
- Earth: 1.0
- Mars: 1.8808158
- Jupiter: 11.862615
- Saturn: 29.447498
- Uranus: 84.016846
- Neptune: 164.79132

Since one Earth year equals 31,557,600 seconds, we can calculate the age in Earth years by dividing the given seconds by this number. Then, to get the age on other planets, we divide the Earth years by their orbital period.

Let's implement this:

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    double age_in_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(double seconds);
    double seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in space_age.cpp:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(double seconds) : age_in_seconds(seconds) {}

double space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_in_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    constexpr double earth_seconds_per_year = 31557600.0;
    return age_in_seconds / earth_seconds_per_year;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    constexpr double mercury_orbital_period = 0.2408467;
    return on_earth() / mercury_orbital_period;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    constexpr double venus_orbital_period = 0.61519726;
    return on_earth() / venus_orbital_period;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    constexpr double mars_orbital_period = 1.8808158;
    return on_earth() / mars_orbital_period;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    constexpr double jupiter_orbital_period = 11.862615;
    return on_earth() / jupiter_orbital_period;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    constexpr double saturn_orbital_period = 29.447498;
    return on_earth() / saturn_orbital_period;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    constexpr double uranus_orbital_period = 84.016846;
    return on_earth() / uranus_orbital_period;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    constexpr double neptune_orbital_period = 164.79132;
    return on_earth() / neptune_orbital_period;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, to ensure precision, we need to be careful with floating point operations. Since the tests may expect specific precision, we need to make sure our calculations are accurate.

This implementation should work by first calculating the age in Earth years, then dividing by each planet's orbital period to get the age on that planet. Let's break it down:
1. The constructor stores the age in seconds
2. seconds() returns the raw age in seconds
3. on_earth() calculates age in Earth years
4. Other functions use on_earth() result to calculate their respective ages

This approach is efficient and avoids code duplication. Let's proceed with this implementation.

I notice that the `on_earth()` function is missing from the class declaration in the header file, but it's being used in the implementation. Let's add it to the header file.

Here are the necessary fixes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    explicit space_age(double seconds);
    double seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;

    explicit space_age(double seconds);
    double seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Wait, it seems `on_earth()` is already present in the provided header file. Let me check the provided content again.

Actually, looking at the provided header file, `on_earth()` is indeed present on line 14. So there must be another issue. Perhaps the error is about something else.

Wait, the user marked lines 11 and 12, which are:
11:    double seconds() const;
12:    double on_mercury() const;

But the implementation seems correct. Maybe the issue is that the implementation needs to be checked against the tests? Or perhaps there are precision issues.

Since the implementation uses floating point division, and the tests might expect precise values, we need to ensure we're using the correct constants and operations.

However, the implementation looks correct. Let's make sure all the function declarations match their implementations. Since the header file shows `on_earth()` is declared, and it's used in the implementation, it should be fine.

Perhaps the issue is that the tests expect `on_earth()` to be defined, and it is, so maybe there's another problem. Let's make sure all the orbital period values are precise enough.

Wait, the instructions say to use 31,557,600 seconds per Earth year, which matches our implementation. Let's use precise values to avoid any floating point errors.

Actually, the implementation seems correct. Maybe the error is in the way the tests are being run or something else. But since we can only modify the provided files, let's ensure everything is consistent.

Wait, the user marked lines 11 and 12, which are the declarations of `seconds()` and `on_mercury()`. Maybe there's a mismatch in the implementation? Let's check:

The implementation of `seconds()` just returns `age_in_seconds`, which matches.
The implementation of `on_mercury()` uses `on_earth() / mercury_orbital_period`, which seems correct.

Perhaps the issue is that the tests expect the age to be calculated in a different way? Or maybe we need to use a more precise approach.

Actually, to avoid any precision issues, we can precompute the number of seconds per year for each planet and divide the age in seconds by that value directly. This might be more precise:

Let's compute for each planet: seconds per year on that planet = Earth seconds per year * orbital period

Wait, no. Age on another planet is (age in Earth years) / (orbital period), which is correct.
But (age in seconds) / (Earth seconds per year) / (orbital period) = (age in seconds) / (Earth seconds per year * orbital period)

So we can compute it directly:
age on planet = age in seconds / (31557600 * orbital period)

This might be more precise by avoiding two division operations.

Let's implement this approach:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH

    constexpr double earth_seconds_per_year = 31557600.0;

```

This implementation should be more precise by doing a single division operation per planet calculation. Let's hope this fixes any precision issues that might be causing errors.

However, the original implementation should also be mathematically correct. Perhaps the tests are very sensitive to floating point precision. This approach might help by reducing floating point error accumulation.

I see. The issue might be that the implementation doesn't match the order of declarations in the header file. The header file declares `on_mercury()` before `on_earth()`, but `on_mercury()` uses `on_earth()` in its implementation. This could cause issues if the compiler expects `on_earth()` to be defined before it's used.

However, since these are member function implementations, and they're all defined within the same compilation unit, the order of implementation shouldn't matter as long as the declarations are present. But to be safe, let's reorder the implementations to match the order in the header.

Wait, but that won't help because `on_mercury()` still needs to call `on_earth()`, which may not be implemented yet. Let's use the direct calculation approach for all functions to avoid dependencies between them.

Here's the fix:

This implementation:
1. Moves `seconds()` to the top to match the order in the header
2. Implements each function independently without calling other member functions
3. Uses direct calculation for each planet's age
4. Maintains the same mathematical correctness

This should resolve any issues related to the order of implementation and dependencies between member functions. Each function now stands on its own and calculates the age directly from the stored seconds.

I understand. The error is due to a duplicate implementation of the `seconds()` function. Let's fix that and ensure all other implementations are correct.

```

The main issue was the duplicate implementation of the `seconds()` function. I removed one of them. The rest of the implementation looks correct:
1. Each function calculates the age on its respective planet by dividing the age in seconds by the number of seconds in a year on that planet
2. The number of seconds in a year on a planet is Earth seconds per year multiplied by the planet's orbital period
3. This matches the mathematical relationship provided in the instructions

This should now compile and pass the tests. Let's run the build again to see if there are any other issues.
