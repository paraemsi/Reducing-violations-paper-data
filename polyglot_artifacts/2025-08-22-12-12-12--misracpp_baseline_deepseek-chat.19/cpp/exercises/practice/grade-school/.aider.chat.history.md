#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.  
####   
#### In the end, you should be able to:  
####   
#### - Add a student's name to the roster for a grade  
####   - "Add Jim to grade 2."  
####   - "OK."  
#### - Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade  
####   - "Which students are in grade 2?"  
####   - "We've only got Jim just now."  
#### - Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  
####   Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.  
####   - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"  
####   - "Let me think.  
####     We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.  
####     So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"  
####   
#### Note that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.  
#### In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grade_school.cpp grade_school.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I understand. We need to implement a school roster system that can add students to grades and retrieve them in a sorted manner. Let's think through this:

1. We need a data structure to store students per grade
2. Each grade should have a list of student names
3. The names should be sorted alphabetically within each grade
4. The grades should be ordered numerically
5. We need to ensure no duplicate students are added to the same grade

Since this is C++, we can use a map where the key is the grade (int) and the value is a vector of strings (student names). We'll always keep the names sorted.

However, the instructions mention that adding the same student more than once should be handled, but it's not clear what to do. Since it says to "indicate that this is incorrect", we might need to track this, but the interface isn't specified. Let's assume we need to prevent adding duplicates.

Wait, the function signatures aren't provided, so we need to define them according to typical C++ practices.

Let's implement:
1. A method to add a student to a grade, ensuring no duplicates
2. A method to get all students in a grade, sorted alphabetically
3. A method to get all students in all grades, with grades ordered numerically and students sorted alphabetically per grade

Here's the implementation:

First, let's update the header file to declare the class and its methods:

grade_school.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(GRADE_SCHOOL_H)
#define GRADE_SCHOOL_H

namespace grade_school {

}  // namespace grade_school

#endif // GRADE_SCHOOL_H
=======
#if !defined(GRADE_SCHOOL_H)
#define GRADE_SCHOOL_H

#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

namespace grade_school {

class school {
private:
    std::map<int, std::vector<std::string>> roster_;
public:
    school();
    std::map<int, std::vector<std::string>> roster() const;
    void add(const std::string& name, int grade);
    std::vector<std::string> grade(int grade) const;
};

}  // namespace grade_school

#endif // GRADE_SCHOOL_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these methods in the cpp file:

grade_school.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "grade_school.h"

namespace grade_school {

}  // namespace grade_school
=======
#include "grade_school.h"
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdexcept>
using namespace std;

namespace grade_school {

school::school() {
    // Initialize an empty roster
}

map<int, vector<string>> school::roster() const {
    // Return a copy of the roster
    // Since roster_ is a map, it's already ordered by grade
    // And each vector is sorted when adding
    return roster_;
}

void school::add(const string& name, int grade) {
    // Check if the student already exists in any grade
    // But the note says "each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster"
    // So the student should be unique across all grades?
    // The instructions are a bit ambiguous
    // Let's check if the name exists in any grade
    for (const auto& entry : roster_) {
        const auto& students = entry.second;
        if (find(students.begin(), students.end(), name) != students.end()) {
            // Student found, throw an exception or do nothing?
            // Since the instructions say to "indicate that this is incorrect", we'll throw
            throw invalid_argument("Student already exists in the roster");
        }
    }
    
    // Add the student to the appropriate grade
    roster_[grade].push_back(name);
    // Sort the names alphabetically
    sort(roster_[grade].begin(), roster_[grade].end());
}

vector<string> school::grade(int grade) const {
    // Return students in the requested grade, or an empty vector if the grade doesn't exist
    auto it = roster_.find(grade);
    if (it != roster_.end()) {
        return it->second;
    }
    return vector<string>();
}

}  // namespace grade_school
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue: the instructions say "each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster". This could mean:
1. A student can't be in the same grade more than once
2. Or a student can't be in any grade more than once (across the entire school)

The implementation above assumes the latter, which is more restrictive. If the first interpretation is correct, we would only need to check within the target grade:
```cpp
// Check if the student exists in the target grade
auto it = roster_.find(grade);
if (it != roster_.end()) {
    const auto& students = it->second;
    if (find(students.begin(), students.end(), name) != students.end()) {
        throw invalid_argument("Student already exists in this grade");
    }
}
```

But since the instructions are a bit ambiguous, I'll proceed with the implementation that's more restrictive (no student can be in the roster more than once at all), which matches the implementation above.

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
1. Adding students to grades while ensuring no duplicates
2. Getting a list of students per grade (already sorted)
3. Getting the entire roster which is ordered by grade number, with students per grade sorted alphabetically

However, the implementation uses exceptions to indicate when adding a duplicate student is incorrect, which is one way to handle it. If the tests expect a different behavior, we may need to adjust.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to match the expected interface and behavior. Let's fix this:

1. The `roster()` function should return a `const` reference to avoid copying
2. The implementation needs to ensure students are unique per grade, not across all grades
3. The implementation needs to always return sorted lists
4. We need to make sure the interface matches what's expected

Wait, the instructions say "each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster", which could mean:
1. A student can't be in the same grade more than once
2. A student can't be in multiple grades at all

But typically, a student is only in one grade, so we need to ensure that when adding, the student isn't already in any grade
However, the implementation needs to be efficient

Let's fix the implementation:

Here are the necessary changes:

        if (binary_search(students.begin(), students.end(), name)) {
            // According to the instructions, this is incorrect

    if (it != roster_.end()) {
        return it->second;
    }
    return vector<string>();
}

}  // namespace grade_school
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We're using `binary_search` which requires the vector to be sorted, which it always is
2. We're inserting the new name in the correct position to maintain sorting, which is more efficient than adding and sorting every time
3. If a student already exists in any grade, we simply don't add them, which "indicates that this is incorrect" by not modifying the roster
4. The `roster()` function now returns a const reference to avoid copying

This implementation should now:
1. Add students to grades while ensuring no duplicates across the entire school
2. Always keep students within each grade sorted alphabetically
3. Keep grades ordered numerically (handled by std::map)
4. Provide access to individual grades and the entire roster

This should now match the expected behavior:
- "Add Jim to grade 2." -> Add to grade 2, keeping the list sorted
- "Which students are in grade 2?" -> Return sorted list from grade 2
- "Who all is enrolled in school right now?" -> Return all students, ordered by grade, with names sorted per grade

Let me know if there are any issues!

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to ensure that when a student is added to a grade, they're not already in that specific grade, not necessarily across all grades. The instructions say "each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster", which could mean:
1. A student can't be in the same grade more than once
2. A student can't be in the roster more than once (i.e., can't be in multiple grades)

But the examples show that students are only in one grade, so we need to ensure that when adding, the student isn't already in any grade
However, the implementation needs to be efficient

Let's fix the implementation to always keep the students sorted and ensure no duplicates:

```

This implementation ensures that:
1. A student can't be added to the same grade more than once
2. A student can't be in multiple grades (the roster)
3. Students within each grade are always sorted alphabetically
4. The roster is ordered by grade number

However, this implementation may not be the most efficient, but it should work for the requirements:
- When adding a student, we check if they're already in the target grade
- We also check if they're in any other grade to prevent being in multiple grades
- We always insert new names in sorted order to maintain the sorting invariant

This should now properly handle cases where:
- "Add Jim to grade 2." -> Add Jim to grade 2 if not present in any grade
- If Jim is already in grade 2, do nothing
- If Jim is in any other grade, do nothing

This matches the instruction that "each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster" by ensuring:
1. No duplicate within a grade
2. No student appears in more than one grade
