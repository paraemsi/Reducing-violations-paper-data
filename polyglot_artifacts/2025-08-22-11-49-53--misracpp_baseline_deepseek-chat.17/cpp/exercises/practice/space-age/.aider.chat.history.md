#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

I understand. We need to implement a class that can calculate someone's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the age is given in seconds, and each planet's year is a multiple of Earth years, we can first calculate the age in Earth years, and then divide by the orbital period ratio for each planet.

First, we need to define a class that can store the age in seconds and provide methods to get the age on each planet.

Wait, the files provided are empty, so we need to implement everything from scratch.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a private member to store age in seconds
2. Add a constructor to initialize with age in seconds
3. Add methods for each planet to calculate the age
4. The age in Earth years is (age in seconds) / 31557600
5. For other planets, divide Earth years by their orbital period

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    long long age_seconds;
public:
    space_age(long long seconds);
    long long seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these methods in space_age.cpp:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_seconds / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return on_earth() / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return on_earth() / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return on_earth() / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should work by:
1. Storing the age in seconds when the object is constructed
2. Providing a method to get the raw seconds
3. Calculating the age on each planet by first computing the Earth age and then dividing by the orbital period ratio
4. Using floating point division to ensure precision

However, the instructions mention that one Earth year equals exactly 31,557,600 seconds, which matches our implementation (31557600.0).

This implementation should be efficient and precise. Let's test it with the provided example:
1,000,000,000 seconds should be 31.69 Earth years, which matches 1,000,000,000 / 31,557,600 ≈ 31.688

Wait, 1,000,000,000 / 31,557,600 ≈ 31.688 which rounds to 31.69, so it matches.

This implementation should be correct. Let's proceed.

I see. The implementation looks correct, but there might be precision issues. Let's ensure that all calculations are precise by using exact values and proper floating point handling.

Wait, the age in seconds is given as a long long, which can be up to 2^63-1, which is about 9.2*10^18. The number of seconds in a year is about 3.16*10^7, so the maximum age in years would be about 2.9*10^11 which fits in a double (which can represent integers precisely up to 2^53).

So our implementation should be fine.

However, to ensure maximum precision, we should avoid repeated divisions and use multiplication where possible. But since the orbital periods are ratios, it's the same.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Let's run through some tests:
1,000,000,000 seconds on Earth: 1,000,000,000 / 31,557,600 ≈ 31.688
Which matches the example (31.69 when rounded to two decimal places)

But perhaps the tests expect exact values. Let's make sure we're using the exact numbers from the instructions.

Wait, the instructions say:
"One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds"
So 365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60 = 31,557,600 exactly

This matches our implementation.

Perhaps the issue is that the function signatures need to be exactly as expected. Let's make sure:
- The constructor takes a long long
- seconds() returns a long long
- All on_* functions return double

This matches our implementation.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Maybe there are no errors, and the markers are just indicating where the relevant code is.

Since the user said "Fix any errors below, if possible" and the implementation seems correct, perhaps there are no errors to fix.

However, to be thorough, let's ensure all calculations are precise by using the exact values from the table:

Wait, the implementation uses division by the orbital period, which is correct:
age on planet = (age in seconds) / (31557600 * orbital period)

But to avoid potential floating point inaccuracies, we could compute directly:
age on planet = age in seconds / (31557600.0 * orbital_period)

But this is the same as dividing by 31557600.0 first and then by orbital_period, due to floating point associativity.

Since the implementation seems correct, I won't change it.

However, if there are precision issues, we could precompute the divisors:
But for now, let's keep it as is.

Since the implementation seems correct, and the user may be asking to fix potential issues, I'll leave it unchanged.

If there are specific errors, the user needs to provide more information.
