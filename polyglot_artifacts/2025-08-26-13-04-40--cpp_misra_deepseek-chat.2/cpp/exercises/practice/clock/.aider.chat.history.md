#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a clock that handles times without dates.  
####   
#### You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.  
####   
#### Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.h clock.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. We need to implement a clock class that can handle times without dates, support adding and subtracting minutes, and ensure that two clocks representing the same time are considered equal. Let's think through this implementation.

Since we're dealing with times, we can represent the time in minutes since midnight (0-1439 minutes per day). This makes it easy to add and subtract minutes while normalizing to a valid time.

However, we need to be careful about wrapping around when adding or subtracting minutes:
- Adding minutes: (current minutes + delta) % 1440, but handle negative values correctly
- Subtracting minutes: similar, but ensure the result is always positive

Since we need to compare clocks for equality, we should implement the equality operator.

Let's implement a Clock class with:
1. A constructor that takes hours and minutes
2. Methods to add and subtract minutes
3. A way to get the time as a string in "HH:MM" format
4. Equality operators

However, the instructions don't specify the exact interface, so we need to be careful. Let's implement it to match typical usage patterns.

Wait, the files are empty, so we need to define everything from scratch.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a Clock class in the namespace
2. Implement the necessary methods
3. Make sure to handle all operations correctly

Here are the necessary changes:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
=======
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

#include <string>
#include <cstdint>

namespace date_independent {

class clock {
private:
    std::int32_t minutes;
    clock(std::int32_t total_minutes);
public:
    static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
    clock plus(std::int32_t add_minutes) const;
    clock minus(std::int32_t sub_minutes) const;
    operator std::string() const;
    bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
    bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;
};

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in clock.cpp:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {

clock::clock(std::int32_t total_minutes) {
    // Normalize to be within 0-1439
    total_minutes %= 1440;
    if (total_minutes < 0) {
        total_minutes += 1440;
    }
    minutes = total_minutes;
}

clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
    return clock(total_minutes);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t add_minutes) const {
    std::int32_t new_minutes = (minutes + add_minutes) % 1440;
    if (new_minutes < 0) {
        new_minutes += 1440;
    }
    return clock(new_minutes);
}

clock clock::minus(std::int32_t sub_minutes) const {
    return plus(-sub_minutes);
}

clock::operator std::string() const {
    std::int32_t hrs = minutes / 60;
    std::int32_t mins = minutes % 60;
    
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hrs << ":"
        << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
    return oss.str();
}

bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
    return minutes == other.minutes;
}

bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
    return !(*this == other);
}

}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The plus and minus operations need to handle wrapping correctly
2. We need to ensure that times are always normalized to be between 00:00 and 23:59
3. The implementation uses modulo arithmetic to handle wrapping
4. When adding or subtracting large numbers of minutes, it will correctly wrap around days

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
1. Add and subtract minutes: done via plus() and minus() methods
2. Two clocks representing the same time are equal: done via operator== which compares the normalized minute values
3. Handles times without dates: we only store minutes since midnight

However, the implementation uses a private constructor, which is fine because we provide a static `at` method to create instances. This ensures that all clock instances are always in a valid state.

Let's test some cases:
- clock::at(8, 0) -> "08:00"
- Adding 3 minutes -> "08:03"
- Subtracting 10 minutes from "10:00" -> "09:50"
- Adding 1440 minutes (24 hours) should wrap around to the same time
- Adding negative minutes should be the same as subtracting

This implementation should handle all these cases correctly.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle the conversion to string properly and ensure all operations work correctly. Let's fix this.

However, there's an important point: the `operator std::string() const` needs to be implemented to return a string in the "HH:MM" format. Let's make sure it always uses two digits for both hours and minutes.

Wait, the implementation in clock.cpp seems correct, but let's ensure it always produces valid times:
- Hours can be 0-23
- Minutes can be 0-59

But the implementation uses `std::int32_t` which is correct according to the rules.

Wait, the implementation needs to handle cases where hours could be negative or very large, which it does by normalizing to 0-1439 minutes.

However, there's a potential issue: when hours are normalized, they might be 24, which should be 0. But since we're always working with minutes % 1440, it's always between 0-1439, which when divided by 60 gives 0-23, which is correct.

Let's fix the implementation to always use two-digit formatting:
- Use modulo 24 for hours? No, better to always use minutes % 1440

Actually, the implementation looks correct, but let's make sure:
- When total_minutes is negative, we add 1440 until it's positive
- But using % can give negative results, so we need to adjust

Wait, the implementation in the constructor uses:
total_minutes %= 1440;
if (total_minutes < 0) total_minutes += 1440;

This ensures minutes is always between 0-1439

Now, when converting to string, hrs can be up to 23 (1439/60=23.983 -> integer division gives 23)
Which is correct.

But to always show two digits, we need to format properly.

Wait, the implementation uses:
oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hrs << ":"
    << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;

This should always show two digits for both hours and minutes.

However, there's a potential issue: if hrs is 0, it will show "00", which is correct.

This seems correct. Let's run through some test cases:
1. clock::at(0, 0) -> "00:00"
2. clock::at(8, 9) -> "08:09"
3. clock::at(23, 59) -> "23:59"
4. clock::at(24, 0) -> "00:00" (but our implementation may handle this differently)

Wait, the implementation of at() doesn't normalize the input, which is passed directly to the constructor which normalizes it.
So clock::at(24, 0) would be 24*60 + 0 = 1440 minutes -> 1440 % 1440 = 0 -> "00:00" which is correct.

This seems correct.

However, the implementation of plus() uses the same approach:
new_minutes = (minutes + add_minutes) % 1440
and adjusts if negative

This should work for all cases.

Wait, there's a potential integer overflow when adding very large numbers, but since we're using 32-bit integers, and minutes is always between 0-1439, and add_minutes can be up to ~2 billion, the sum could overflow.
But in C++, signed integer overflow is undefined behavior.

To fix this, we need to avoid overflow by using modulo arithmetic differently:
Instead of (a + b) % m, we can compute it in a way that prevents overflow.

But since 1440 fits in 32 bits, and the maximum value of minutes + add_minutes could be up to ~1439 + 2^31-1 which can overflow.
Let's use a 64-bit integer for intermediate calculations.

Wait, the rules say to use fixed-width types, so we should use std::int64_t

Here are the necessary fixes:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
clock::clock(std::int32_t total_minutes) {
    // Normalize to be within 0-1439
    total_minutes %= 1440;
    if (total_minutes < 0) {
        total_minutes += 1440;
    }
    minutes = total_minutes;
}

clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
    return clock(total_minutes);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t add_minutes) const {
    std::int32_t new_minutes = (minutes + add_minutes) % 1440;
    if (new_minutes < 0) {
        new_minutes += 1440;
    }
    return clock(new_minutes);
}
=======
clock::clock(std::int32_t total_minutes) {
    // Normalize to be within 0-1439
    // Use 64-bit to handle large values
    std::int64_t normalized = total_minutes % 1440;
    if (normalized < 0) {
        normalized += 1440;
    }
    minutes = static_cast<std::int32_t>(normalized);
}

clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
    // Use 64-bit to prevent overflow
    std::int64_t total_minutes = (static_cast<std::int64_t>(hours) * 60) + minutes;
    return clock(static_cast<std::int32_t>(total_minutes));
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t add_minutes) const {
    // Use 64-bit to prevent overflow
    std::int64_t new_minutes = (static_cast<std::int64_t>(minutes) + add_minutes) % 1440;
    if (new_minutes < 0) {
        new_minutes += 1440;
    }
    return clock(static_cast<std::int32_t>(new_minutes));
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation uses 64-bit integers for intermediate calculations to prevent overflow, then casts back to 32-bit when storing, which is safe because the result is always between 0-1439.

The rest of the implementation looks correct:
1. minus() uses plus(-sub_minutes) which will work with the new implementation
2. The string conversion is correct
3. The comparison operators are correct

This should now handle all cases correctly, including very large numbers of minutes being added or subtracted.
