#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: space_age.cpp space_age.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a class that can calculate someone's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the age is given in seconds, and each planet's year is defined relative to Earth years, we can first calculate the age in Earth years, and then divide by the orbital period ratio to get the age on other planets.

First, let's define the orbital periods and the number of seconds in an Earth year:
1 Earth year = 31557600 seconds

Now, to get the age on any planet, we can use:
age_on_planet = (age_in_seconds) / (orbital_period_ratio * 31557600)

Wait, but according to the example:
1,000,000,000 seconds should be 31.69 Earth years, which matches:
1,000,000,000 / 31557600 ≈ 31.688

So for other planets, we need to divide the Earth years by their orbital period:
age_on_planet = (age_in_seconds / 31557600) / orbital_period_ratio

Wait, but the orbital period is in Earth years, so:
Mercury's orbital period is 0.2408467 Earth years, which means a Mercury year is shorter
So more years fit into the same number of seconds:
age_on_mercury = (age_in_seconds / 31557600) / 0.2408467 ≈ 131.569

Now, let's implement this in the class. We'll need to store the age in seconds and provide methods to get the age on each planet.

Here's the implementation:

Wait, the files are empty, so we need to add everything from scratch.

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp

#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)

    explicit space_age(std::int64_t age_in_seconds);
    std::int64_t seconds() const;

    double on_neptune() const;

private:
    std::int64_t age_seconds;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(std::int64_t age_in_seconds) : age_seconds(age_in_seconds) {}

std::int64_t space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, to ensure precision, we need to be careful with floating point operations. Since the age in seconds can be a large integer, we need to cast it to double to prevent integer overflow during division.

This implementation should work according to the instructions:
1. The constructor takes an age in seconds
2. The seconds() method returns the raw age in seconds
3. Each on_planet() method calculates the age on that planet using the provided orbital periods

Let's test the provided example:
1,000,000,000 seconds on Earth: 1,000,000,000 / 31,557,600 ≈ 31.688 which matches 31.69 when rounded
This seems correct.

This implementation follows the MISRA C++ rules:
1. Using std::int64_t from <cstdint>
2. Using explicit casts where necessary
3. Using floating point types appropriately
4. No mixing of integral and floating point types without proper casting

However, to be precise, we need to ensure all operations are done with floating point numbers to maintain precision. The implementation uses static_cast<double> to convert the integer age_seconds to a floating point number before division.

I understand. The implementation needs to be precise and follow best practices. Let's look at potential issues:

1. The implementation may have precision issues
2. We can pre-calculate the Earth age to avoid repeated divisions
3. We need to ensure all calculations are accurate

However, the implementation seems correct. Let's test the numbers:
Earth year in seconds: 31557600
This matches the instruction: 365.25 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds = 31557600

Wait, the implementation divides by the orbital period, which is correct:
age_on_planet = (age_in_seconds / earth_seconds_per_year) / orbital_period

But to improve precision, we can precompute the Earth age and reuse it:
double earth_years = static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0;

However, the implementation is correct as is. Let's see if there are any other issues.

Actually, the implementation might be fine, but perhaps the tests expect a certain precision. Let's make sure we're using the exact values from the instructions.

Wait, the implementation uses:
return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / orbital_period;

This is correct. But to improve readability and avoid potential precision issues, we can use multiplication by the reciprocal:
return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / (31557600.0 * orbital_period);

This may be more precise and efficient.

Let's update the implementation:

space_age.cpp
```cpp

```

This implementation uses a single division which may be more precise and efficient. Let's hope this satisfies any precision requirements.

However, the header file seems fine. The implementation now uses multiplication of the Earth year in seconds with the orbital period, which is mathematically equivalent to the previous implementation but may have better numerical properties.

This should now be more precise and follow best practices. Let's see if this resolves any issues.
