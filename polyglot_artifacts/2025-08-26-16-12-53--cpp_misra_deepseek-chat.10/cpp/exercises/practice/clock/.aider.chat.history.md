#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a clock that handles times without dates.  
####   
#### You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.  
####   
#### Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.cpp clock.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. We need to implement a clock class that can handle times without dates, support adding and subtracting minutes, and ensure that two clocks representing the same time are considered equal. Let's think through this implementation.

Since we're dealing with times, we can represent the time in minutes since 00:00 (midnight). This makes adding and subtracting minutes straightforward. We'll need to handle wrapping around 24 hours (1440 minutes).

However, the instructions don't specify the exact interface, but typically, we'd need:
1. A way to create a clock at a specific hour and minute
2. Methods to add and subtract minutes
3. Equality comparison
4. A way to get the time as a string in "HH:MM" format

Since the namespace is provided, we'll implement within that namespace. Let's define a Clock class.

Wait, the files are empty, so we need to define everything from scratch.

Here's the plan:
1. Define a Clock class in the header
2. Implement methods to create clocks, add/subtract minutes, and compare
3. Handle time normalization to always be within 0-1439 minutes

Here are the necessary changes:

First, let's update the header file to include the Clock class definition:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
=======
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

#include <string>
#include <cstdint>

namespace date_independent {

class clock {
private:
    std::int32_t minutes_;
    
    // Private constructor
    clock(std::int32_t minutes);
    
public:
    // Create a clock at a specific hour and minute
    static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
    
    // Add minutes
    clock plus(std::int32_t minutes) const;
    
    // Subtract minutes - we can implement minus by adding negative minutes
    // But to be explicit, let's have a minus function
    clock minus(std::int32_t minutes) const;
    
    // Convert to string
    operator std::string() const;
    
    // Comparison operators
    bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
    bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;
};

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the methods in the cpp file:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {

clock::clock(std::int32_t minutes) : minutes_((minutes % 1440 + 1440) % 1440) {}

clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
    // Convert everything to minutes and normalize
    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
    return clock(total_minutes);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    return clock(minutes_ + minutes);
}

clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    return clock(minutes_ - minutes);
}

clock::operator std::string() const {
    std::int32_t hours = minutes_ / 60;
    std::int32_t minutes = minutes_ % 60;
    
    // Format to HH:MM
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
        << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << minutes;
    return oss.str();
}

bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
    return minutes_ == other.minutes_;
}

bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
    return minutes_ != other.minutes_;
}

}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The implementation normalizes the time to always be within 0-1439 minutes by using modulo arithmetic
2. We handle negative values by adding 1440 before taking modulo to ensure positive results
3. The time is always valid (between 00:00 and 23:59)
4. We use fixed-width integer types as per the rules
5. All operations are precise and don't involve any narrowing conversions

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
1. Adding and subtracting minutes is handled by creating new clock instances with adjusted minute counts
2. Two clocks are equal if their internal minute counts are equal
3. Times are always valid and properly formatted

However, the implementation uses a private constructor, which is fine because we provide a static `at` method to create instances. This ensures that all clock instances are always in a valid state.

Let's test this approach:
- clock::at(8, 0) -> "08:00"
- Adding 3 minutes: clock::at(8, 0).plus(3) -> "08:03"
- Subtracting 3 minutes: clock::at(8, 0).minus(3) -> "07:57"
- Times wrap around: clock::at(23, 59).plus(2) -> "00:01"

This implementation should handle all these cases correctly.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle hours and minutes correctly, especially when they can be negative or very large. Let's fix that.

The key is to always normalize the time to be within 0-1439 minutes (24 hours). However, the implementation needs to handle large values of hours and minutes correctly.

Wait, the `at` function takes hours and minutes, which could be negative or very large. We need to convert them to total minutes and then normalize.

Here are the necessary fixes:

1. The normalization should handle very large positive and negative values correctly
2. We need to ensure that hours and minutes are always valid when creating the clock
3. The implementation needs to be robust

Let's fix the implementation:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {

clock::clock(std::int32_t minutes) : minutes_((minutes % 1440 + 1440) % 1440) {}

clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
    // Convert everything to minutes and normalize
    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
    return clock(total_minutes);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    return clock(minutes_ + minutes);
}

clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    return clock(minutes_ - minutes);
}

clock::operator std::string() const {
    std::int32_t hours = minutes_ / 60;
    std::int32_t minutes = minutes_ % 60;
    
    // Format to HH:MM
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
        << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << minutes;
    return oss.str();
}

bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
    return minutes_ == other.minutes_;
}

bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
    return minutes_ != other.minutes_;
}

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {

clock::clock(std::int32_t minutes) : minutes_((minutes % 1440 + 1440) % 1440) {}

clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
    // Convert everything to minutes and normalize
    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
    // Handle negative total_minutes by ensuring we always get a positive value within 0-1439
    // The constructor already normalizes, so we can just pass it
    return clock(total_minutes);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    return clock(minutes_ + minutes);
}

clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    return clock(minutes_ - minutes);
}

clock::operator std::string() const {
    std::int32_t hours = minutes_ / 60;
    std::int32_t minutes = minutes_ % 60;
    // Ensure hours are within 0-23
    // Since minutes_ is always between 0-1439, hours will be between 0-23
    // Format to HH:MM
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
        << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << minutes;
    return oss.str();
}

bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
    return minutes_ == other.minutes_;
}

bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
    return minutes_ != other.minutes_;
}

}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue when hours and minutes are very large or negative, which could cause integer overflow when multiplying hours by 60. But since we're using std::int32_t, which can hold up to around 2 billion, and 24 hours is 1440 minutes, this should be fine for reasonable inputs.

Wait, the maximum value for std::int32_t is 2,147,483,647
60 * 35,791,394 ≈ 2,147,483,640 which is very large
So it's possible to have integer overflow if hours is very large

To prevent this, we need to handle the conversion differently:
Convert hours and minutes to total minutes in a way that doesn't overflow
But since the maximum number of minutes we care about is modulo 1440, we can compute (hours * 60 + minutes) mod 1440 directly

But to avoid overflow, we can compute it in parts:
total_minutes = ( (hours % (1440/60)) * 60 + minutes ) % 1440
But this isn't correct because hours could be very large

Actually, the best approach is to compute everything modulo 1440:
total_minutes = ( ( (hours % 24) * 60 ) % 1440 + minutes % 1440 ) % 1440
But this needs to handle negative values correctly

Wait, the constructor normalizes the total minutes, so we can compute total_minutes directly and let the constructor handle it
But to prevent overflow, we need to be careful

Since 1440 is 24*60, and hours can be up to ~35 million before overflow, which is large, but possible
To prevent overflow, we can cast to int64_t during computation

Wait, the rules say to use fixed-width types, so let's use std::int64_t

Wait, but the interface uses std::int32_t, so we need to cast
Let's fix the implementation to prevent overflow:

Wait, the implementation needs to be fixed to handle very large hours and minutes without overflow
Here's a better approach:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
    // Convert everything to minutes and normalize
    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
    // Handle negative total_minutes by ensuring we always get a positive value within 0-1439
    // The constructor already normalizes, so we can just pass it
    return clock(total_minutes);
}
=======
clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
    // Convert to total minutes using int64_t to prevent overflow
    std::int64_t total_minutes = static_cast<std::int64_t>(hours) * 60 + minutes;
    // Normalize to be within 0-1439
    total_minutes %= 1440;
    if (total_minutes < 0) {
        total_minutes += 1440;
    }
    return clock(static_cast<std::int32_t>(total_minutes));
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation uses a 64-bit integer to prevent overflow during the calculation, then normalizes the result to be within 0-1439 minutes. This should handle very large positive and negative values for hours and minutes correctly.

However, according to the rules, we need to be careful about assignments between numeric types. Here, we're casting from int64_t to int32_t, which could potentially narrow if total_minutes is outside the int32_t range. But since total_minutes is always between 0 and 1439, which fits in int32_t, this is safe.

This implementation should now handle:
- Large positive and negative hours and minutes
- Proper wrapping around 24 hours
- All operations without integer overflow issues

Let's hope this satisfies all requirements and the MISRA C++ rules.
