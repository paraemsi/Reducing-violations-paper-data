#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Every month, your partner meets up with their best friend.  
#### Both of them have very busy schedules, making it challenging to find a suitable date!  
#### Given your own busy schedule, your partner always double-checks potential meetup dates with you:  
####   
#### - "Can I meet up on the first Friday of next month?"  
#### - "What about the third Wednesday?"  
#### - "Maybe the last Sunday?"  
####   
#### In this month's call, your partner asked you this question:  
####   
#### - "I'd like to meet up on the teenth Thursday; is that okay?"  
####   
#### Confused, you ask what a "teenth" day is.  
#### Your partner explains that a teenth day, a concept they made up, refers to the days in a month that end in '-teenth':  
####   
#### - 13th (thirteenth)  
#### - 14th (fourteenth)  
#### - 15th (fifteenth)  
#### - 16th (sixteenth)  
#### - 17th (seventeenth)  
#### - 18th (eighteenth)  
#### - 19th (nineteenth)  
####   
#### As there are also seven weekdays, it is guaranteed that each day of the week has _exactly one_ teenth day each month.  
####   
#### Now that you understand the concept of a teenth day, you check your calendar.  
#### You don't have anything planned on the teenth Thursday, so you happily confirm the date with your partner.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to find the exact date of a meetup, given a month, year, weekday and week.  
####   
#### There are five week values to consider: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, `last`, `teenth`.  
####   
#### For example, you might be asked to find the date for the meetup on the first Monday in January 2018 (January 1, 2018).  
####   
#### Similarly, you might be asked to find:  
####   
#### - the third Tuesday of August 2019 (August 20, 2019)  
#### - the teenth Wednesday of May 2020 (May 13, 2020)  
#### - the fourth Sunday of July 2021 (July 25, 2021)  
#### - the last Thursday of November 2022 (November 24, 2022)  
#### - the teenth Saturday of August 1953 (August 15, 1953)  
####   
#### ## Teenth  
####   
#### The teenth week refers to the seven days in a month that end in '-teenth' (13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th).  
####   
#### If asked to find the teenth Saturday of August, 1953, we check its calendar:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
####     August 1953  
#### Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
####                    1  
####  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  
####  9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
#### 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  
#### 23 24 25 26 27 28 29  
#### 30 31  
#### ```  
####   
#### From this we find that the teenth Saturday is August 15, 1953.  
####

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: meetup.h meetup.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
