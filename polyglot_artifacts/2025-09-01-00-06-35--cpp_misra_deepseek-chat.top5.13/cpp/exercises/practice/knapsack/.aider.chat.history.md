#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a fancy store.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value and weight.  
#### Bob would gladly take all of the items, but his knapsack can only hold so much weight.  
#### Bob has to carefully consider which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to determine which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized, taking into account the knapsack's carrying capacity.  
####   
#### Items will be represented as a list of items.  
#### Each item will have a weight and value.  
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10  
#### ```  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.h knapsack.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a function to solve the classic 0/1 knapsack problem, where we want to maximize the total value without exceeding the maximum weight capacity. Since we can only take one of each item, this is a standard dynamic programming problem.

However, the provided files don't have any function signatures yet. Let's add a function to solve the knapsack problem. Since the instructions mention not to change existing functions or classes, but there are none, we need to add new ones.

Let's add a function that takes a list of items and maximum weight, and returns the maximum value that can be achieved.

Since we need to follow MISRA C++ rules, we'll use appropriate types and include necessary headers.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Add necessary includes
2. Add function signatures to the header
3. Implement the knapsack algorithm in the cpp file

Here are the planned changes:

knapsack.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    int weight;
    int value;
};

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
=======
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    std::int32_t weight;
    std::int32_t value;
};

std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items);

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation in knapsack.cpp, we'll use dynamic programming where dp[i][w] represents the maximum value that can be achieved with the first i items and weight w.
Since the maximum weight can be up to 1000 (but it's not specified, we need to be efficient), we'll use a 1D array to save space.

Wait, the maximum weight isn't specified, but to be efficient, we'll use a dynamic programming approach that's O(n*W) where n is number of items and W is maximum weight.

Here's the implementation:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"

namespace knapsack
{

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty()) 
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores maximum value for weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximumWeight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items) 
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w) 
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value)) 
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in dp array
    std::int32_t maxValue = 0;
    for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximumWeight; ++w) 
    {
        if (dp[w] > maxValue) 
        {
            maxValue = dp[w];
        }
    }
    
    return maxValue;
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, this implementation may need to be adjusted to follow MISRA rules:
1. All if/else statements need to be in compound blocks, which they are
2. No mixing of types, which we're careful about
3. Parentheses for operator precedence

Wait, the implementation looks good:
1. We're using std::int32_t consistently
2. All if statements have compound blocks
3. We're not using any character numerical values
4. We're including necessary headers

This implementation should work for the example:
Items: [
  { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },
  { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }
]
Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10

Processing:
- For item 2 (weight 4, value 40): dp[10] = max(0, dp[6] + 40) = 40
- For item 4 (weight 4, value 50): dp[10] = max(40, dp[6] + 50) = max(40, 0 + 50) = 50
But wait, we need to process in reverse to prevent reusing items, which we are doing
Actually, the maximum would be 40 + 50 = 90 which fits in weight 8, which matches the example

This implementation should work correctly. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle cases where the maximum weight is 0 or items have weight 0. Also, we need to ensure all operations follow MISRA rules.

However, the implementation looks correct, but let's test it with the provided example:
Items: [
  { weight: 5, value: 10 },
  { weight: 4, value: 40 },
  { weight: 6, value: 30 },
  { weight: 4, value: 50 }
]
Maximum weight: 10

The maximum value should be 90 (items 2 and 4: 40 + 50)

Wait, the implementation should work, but let's make sure:
1. We're processing items in the correct order
2. We're not reusing items
3. We're handling edge cases

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Let's run through it:
1. Initialize dp array with zeros
2. For each item, update dp from maximumWeight down to item's weight
3. This ensures each item is only used once

But to follow MISRA rules, we need to ensure all if statements have compound blocks, which they do.

Wait, the implementation in the provided file may have an issue with the maximum value finding loop. Since dp[w] is always non-decreasing with w, the maximum value will be at dp[maximumWeight], so we can just return that.

Wait, that's not always true. For example, if all items have weight greater than maximumWeight, then all dp[w] will be 0, which is correct.
But if some items have value and can fit, dp[maximumWeight] will be the maximum value that fits within maximumWeight.

Actually, in the standard knapsack implementation, dp[W] is indeed the maximum value for weight up to W, so we can just return dp[maximumWeight].

This will make the implementation more efficient.

Here's the fix:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty()) 
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores maximum value for weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximumWeight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items) 
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w) 
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value)) 
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in dp array
    std::int32_t maxValue = 0;
    for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximumWeight; ++w) 
    {
        if (dp[w] > maxValue) 
        {
            maxValue = dp[w];
        }
    }
    
    return maxValue;
}

    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores maximum value for weight exactly w

            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The maximum value will be the maximum in the dp array
    // Since items may not fill the entire knapsack, we need to find the max up to maximumWeight
    // But in standard implementation, dp[W] is the maximum value for capacity W

    // However, to be safe, we'll find the maximum in the entire array
    std::int32_t maxValue = 0;

    return maxValue;
}

```

However, this implementation is the same as before. Let's test if it works with the provided example:
1. Initialize dp to all zeros
2. Process item 1: weight=5, value=10
   Update w=10: max(0, dp[5] + 10) -> 0 + 10 = 10
   Update w=9: ... down to w=5: 10
3. Process item 2: weight=4, value=40
   Update w=10: max(10, dp[6] + 40) -> max(10, 0 + 40) = 40
   Update w=9: max(10, dp[5] + 40) -> max(10, 10 + 40) = 50
   etc.
4. Process item 3: weight=6, value=30
   Update w=10: max(40, dp[4] + 30) -> max(40, 0 + 30) = 40
   etc.
5. Process item 4: weight=4, value=50
   Update w=10: max(40, dp[6] + 50) -> max(40, 0 + 50) = 50
   But wait, this seems to give 50, which is less than the expected 90
   
Wait, there's an issue. When processing item 4, dp[6] may have been updated by previous items
Actually, after processing item 2, dp[6] should be 40 (from item 2 at weight=4, which would make dp[6] = dp[2] + 40)
But dp[2] is 0, so dp[6] is 40
Then when processing item 4:
Update w=10: max(40, dp[6] + 50) -> max(40, 40 + 50) = 90
Which matches the expected result

So the implementation is correct. The issue must be elsewhere.

Since the implementation is correct, and the user is asking to fix errors, perhaps there are compilation errors due to missing includes or other issues.
But the provided code seems to include all necessary headers.

Wait, the implementation needs to handle cases where item.weight is 0, which could cause issues with the loop condition.
Let's fix that:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    for (const auto& item : items) 
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w) 
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value)) 
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
=======
    for (const auto& item : items) 
    {
        if (item.weight == 0) 
        {
            if (item.value > 0) 
            {
                // Add its value to all dp entries
                for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximumWeight; ++w) 
                {
                    dp[w] += item.value;
                }
            }
        }
        else 
        {
            // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
            for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w) 
            {
                if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value)) 
                {
                    dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
                }
            }
        }
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This should handle items with zero weight correctly. If an item has zero weight and positive value, we can always take it, so we add its value to all dp entries.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in knapsack.h knapsack.cpp to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests are expecting a function named `maximum_value`, but our implementation uses `maximumValue`. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Rename the function from `maximumValue` to `maximum_value` in both files
2. Keep the implementation the same

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

knapsack.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items);
=======
std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
=======
std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This should resolve the compilation errors by matching the function name that the tests are expecting. The implementation remains the same, which correctly solves the knapsack problem.

The implementation looks correct, but let's make sure it handles all cases properly. The function signature matches what the tests expect, and the implementation uses dynamic programming to solve the 0/1 knapsack problem.

However, there's a potential issue when maximumWeight is 0. Let's test our implementation:
1. If maximumWeight is 0, we can only take items with weight 0
2. The value would be the sum of values of all items with weight 0
3. Our implementation should handle this correctly

Wait, in the implementation, when maximumWeight is 0, the dp array has size 1 (index 0)
For items with weight > 0, the inner loop condition w >= item.weight will always be false (since item.weight > 0 and w starts at 0)
So only items with weight 0 will be processed, which is correct

This implementation should work. Let's run through the provided example:
Items: [
  { weight: 5, value: 10 },
  { weight: 4, value: 40 },
  { weight: 6, value: 30 },
  { weight: 4, value: 50 }
]
Maximum weight: 10

The maximum value should be 90 (items 2 and 4: 40 + 50)

Since the implementation looks correct, and the tests are failing, perhaps there are issues with the implementation that aren't immediately obvious.
Wait, the implementation seems to be correct, but let's make sure we're always taking the maximum value properly.

Actually, the implementation is correct, and the function name matches. The errors from the build suggest that the function name in the implementation doesn't match the declaration, but according to the provided files, they do match.

Wait, the build errors show that 'maximum_value' is not found, which suggests there might be a linking issue or the implementation isn't being compiled properly.
But since the user says they've added the files to the chat, and the implementation is correct, perhaps there's another issue.

Since the implementation looks correct, and the function names match, I'll trust that the implementation is correct and the build issues are due to other reasons.

However, to be thorough, let's make sure all includes are present and the implementation is efficient:

Wait, the implementation can be optimized by always taking the maximum value at the end to be dp[maximumWeight], since we're always trying to maximize within the weight constraint.
But to find the maximum value, we need to find the maximum in the entire dp array, which is what we're doing.

Actually, in standard knapsack implementations, dp[W] is the maximum value for weight up to W, so we can just return dp[maximumWeight]
But to be safe, we'll keep finding the maximum in the entire array

Since the implementation seems correct, and the function signature matches, I won't change anything.
