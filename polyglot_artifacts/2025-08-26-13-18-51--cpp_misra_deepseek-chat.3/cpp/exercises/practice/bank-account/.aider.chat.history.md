#### # Introduction  
####   
#### After years of filling out forms and waiting, you've finally acquired your banking license.  
#### This means you are now officially eligible to open your own bank, hurray!  
####   
#### Your first priority is to get the IT systems up and running.  
#### After a day of hard work, you can already open and close accounts, as well as handle withdrawals and deposits.  
####   
#### Since you couldn't be bothered writing tests, you invite some friends to help test the system.  
#### However, after just five minutes, one of your friends claims they've lost money!  
#### While you're confident your code is bug-free, you start looking through the logs to investigate.  
####   
#### Ah yes, just as you suspected, your friend is at fault!  
#### They shared their test credentials with another friend, and together they conspired to make deposits and withdrawals from the same account _in parallel_.  
#### Who would do such a thing?  
####   
#### While you argue that it's physically _impossible_ for someone to access their account in parallel, your friend smugly notifies you that the banking rules _require_ you to support this.  
#### Thus, no parallel banking support, no go-live signal.  
#### Sighing, you create a mental note to work on this tomorrow.  
#### This will set your launch date back at _least_ one more day, but well...  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
####   
#### As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), your bank software must allow accounts to be safely accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.  
#### For example, there may be many deposits and withdrawals occurring in parallel; you need to ensure there are no [race conditions][wikipedia] between when you read the account balance and set the new balance.  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
####   
#### [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.cpp bank_account.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a thread-safe bank account class that supports deposits, withdrawals, and account status (open/closed). Since multiple threads can access the account simultaneously, we need to use synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

Since this is C++, we'll use a mutex to protect access to the account balance and status. Let's implement this.

First, let's update the header file to include necessary members and methods:

bank_account.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
=======
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <mutex>
#include <cstdint>

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {
public:
    Bankaccount();
    void open();
    void close();
    void deposit(std::int64_t amount);
    void withdraw(std::int64_t amount);
    std::int64_t balance() const;
    
private:
    mutable std::mutex mtx;
    std::int64_t current_balance;
    bool is_open;
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the methods in the cpp file:

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "bank_account.h"

namespace Bankaccount {}
=======
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : current_balance(0), is_open(false) {
}

void Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is already open");
    }
    is_open = true;
    current_balance = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is not open");
    }
    is_open = false;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    current_balance += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    if (amount > current_balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    current_balance -= amount;
}

std::int64_t Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    return current_balance;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. All operations are now thread-safe due to the mutex
2. We check if the account is open before performing operations
3. We validate input amounts to ensure they're positive
4. We check for sufficient funds before allowing withdrawals
5. The balance() method also checks if the account is open

This implementation should handle parallel access safely:
- The mutex ensures that only one thread can access the account's state at a time
- All operations that modify or read the balance are protected
- The account status is also protected by the mutex

However, there's a potential issue: the balance() method is marked as const, but we're locking a mutable mutex which is fine. This is a common pattern to allow synchronization in const methods.

This implementation should now support:
1. Opening and closing accounts
2. Deposits and withdrawals in a thread-safe manner
3. Balance checking
4. Proper error handling for invalid operations

Let me know if you have any questions or need further modifications!

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to match the expected interface. The provided signatures in the header file must be preserved, and we need to ensure all operations are thread-safe. Let's fix the implementation.

However, the implementation needs to throw specific exceptions:
1. When trying to perform operations on a closed account
2. When trying to deposit or withdraw invalid amounts
3. When trying to withdraw more than the current balance

Wait, the interface in the header file shows:
- deposit and withdraw take std::int64_t parameters
- balance returns std::int64_t

But according to the instructions, we need to be careful about integer types. Let's make sure our implementation follows the rules.

Here are the necessary fixes:

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : current_balance(0), is_open(false) {
}

void Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is already open");
    }
    is_open = true;
    current_balance = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is not open");
    }
    is_open = false;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    current_balance += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    if (amount > current_balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    current_balance -= amount;
}

std::int64_t Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    return current_balance;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
=======
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : current_balance(0), is_open(false) {
}

void Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is already open");
    }
    is_open = true;
    current_balance = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is not open");
    }
    is_open = false;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Invalid deposit amount");
    }
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    current_balance += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Invalid withdrawal amount");
    }
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    if (amount > current_balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    current_balance -= amount;
}

std::int64_t Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    return current_balance;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few adjustments:
1. We check the amount validity before acquiring the lock to avoid holding the lock during checks that don't need it
2. The error messages are adjusted to be consistent
3. All operations are still thread-safe due to proper locking

This implementation ensures:
1. Thread safety through proper use of mutex
2. Account status is always checked before performing operations
3. Valid amounts are used for deposits and withdrawals
4. Sufficient funds are checked before allowing withdrawals
5. The balance can only be read when the account is open

However, the exact error messages may need to match what the tests expect. If there are issues, we may need to adjust them.

This implementation should now work correctly for parallel access:
- Multiple threads can safely call deposit(), withdraw(), and balance()
- The mutex ensures that only one operation modifies or reads the account state at a time
- All operations properly check if the account is open before proceeding
- Invalid operations throw appropriate exceptions

Let me know if you encounter any issues with this implementation!
