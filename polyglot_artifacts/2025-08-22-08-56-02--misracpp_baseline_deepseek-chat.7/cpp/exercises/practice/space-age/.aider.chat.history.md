#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

I understand. We need to create a class that can calculate someone's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's implement this functionality.

Since the problem is in C++, we'll create a class that takes the age in seconds in its constructor and provides member functions to get the age on each planet.

First, let's define the class in the header file:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    long long age_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(long long seconds);
    long long seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the class in the source file:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_seconds / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return on_earth() / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return on_earth() / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return on_earth() / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to make sure the implementation is precise. Since the problem states that one Earth year equals 31,557,600 seconds, which is exactly 365.25 days, we can use that directly.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Let's test the numbers:
- For 1,000,000,000 seconds, on_earth() should be 1,000,000,000 / 31,557,600 ≈ 31.69
- For other planets, we divide by their orbital period relative to Earth

This implementation should work. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to be precise to pass tests. Let's make sure all calculations are accurate. The issue might be with floating point precision or the way we're calculating the ages.

Since the tests might expect very specific values, we need to ensure our implementation is precise. Let's use the exact values provided and compute each planet's age directly from the seconds, rather than relying on chained divisions which could compound floating point errors.

Wait, the implementation looks correct, but perhaps the tests expect the `seconds()` function to return the exact number of seconds passed to the constructor, and the age calculations to be precise.

However, to ensure maximum precision, let's compute each planet's age directly from the seconds using the orbital period ratios:
age = seconds / (earth_seconds_per_year * orbital_period)

But according to the table, the orbital periods are relative to Earth years, so:
age_on_planet = (seconds / earth_seconds_per_year) / orbital_period

This matches what we have, but perhaps we need to use more precise values or a different approach.

Wait, the instructions say:
"One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds"

So earth_seconds_per_year is exactly 31557600

Let's precompute the divisor for each planet as earth_seconds_per_year * orbital_period
This might be more precise.

Wait, but the implementation seems correct. Maybe the issue is that the tests expect the `seconds()` function to be implemented, and it's not matching exactly.

Let's make sure all functions are implemented correctly.

Wait, the implementation looks fine. Perhaps there's a typo or something else.
Actually, the implementation seems correct, but let's use a more precise approach by computing each planet's age directly:

Wait, the implementation is:
on_earth() -> seconds / 31557600.0
on_mercury() -> on_earth() / 0.2408467

But this should be correct. Maybe the tests want the age to be in Earth years, which is what on_earth() returns, and other planets are based on that.

Wait, the instructions say to calculate how old someone would be on other planets, which means:
age_on_planet = (age_in_seconds) / (orbital_period * 31557600)

So for Mercury: age_in_seconds / (0.2408467 * 31557600)
This is the same as on_earth() / 0.2408467

So our implementation is correct.

Perhaps the issue is with floating point precision. Let's use the exact values to compute each age directly:

Wait, but the implementation seems correct. Maybe the tests are failing because of something else.

Let's reimplement using direct computation for each function to avoid any potential issues with floating point precision:

Wait, but the implementation is correct. Maybe the tests expect the values to be precise to a certain number of decimal places.

Actually, let's use the exact approach for each function:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_seconds / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return on_earth() / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return on_earth() / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return on_earth() / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_seconds / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 0.2408467);
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 0.61519726);
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 1.8808158);
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 11.862615);
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 29.447498);
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 84.016846);
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 164.79132);
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation computes each planet's age directly from the number of seconds, which might be more precise and avoid any floating point errors that could accumulate from calling on_earth() first and then dividing.

This should now pass any precision-related tests. Let's hope this fixes the issues.
