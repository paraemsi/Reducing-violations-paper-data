#### # Introduction  
####   
#### After years of filling out forms and waiting, you've finally acquired your banking license.  
#### This means you are now officially eligible to open your own bank, hurray!  
####   
#### Your first priority is to get the IT systems up and running.  
#### After a day of hard work, you can already open and close accounts, as well as handle withdrawals and deposits.  
####   
#### Since you couldn't be bothered writing tests, you invite some friends to help test the system.  
#### However, after just five minutes, one of your friends claims they've lost money!  
#### While you're confident your code is bug-free, you start looking through the logs to investigate.  
####   
#### Ah yes, just as you suspected, your friend is at fault!  
#### They shared their test credentials with another friend, and together they conspired to make deposits and withdrawals from the same account _in parallel_.  
#### Who would do such a thing?  
####   
#### While you argue that it's physically _impossible_ for someone to access their account in parallel, your friend smugly notifies you that the banking rules _require_ you to support this.  
#### Thus, no parallel banking support, no go-live signal.  
#### Sighing, you create a mental note to work on this tomorrow.  
#### This will set your launch date back at _least_ one more day, but well...  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
####   
#### As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), your bank software must allow accounts to be safely accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.  
#### For example, there may be many deposits and withdrawals occurring in parallel; you need to ensure there are no [race conditions][wikipedia] between when you read the account balance and set the new balance.  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
####   
#### [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.cpp bank_account.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a thread-safe bank account system that supports deposits, withdrawals, and account status (open/closed). Since multiple threads can access the account simultaneously, we need to use synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

Since this is C++, we can use mutexes from the standard library to ensure thread safety. Let's implement this:

1. Add necessary includes
2. Add a balance member variable
3. Add a status flag to track if the account is open or closed
4. Use a mutex to synchronize access to the account
5. Implement the required operations: deposit, withdraw, get balance, open, close

However, the provided files seem to have an empty implementation. Let's add the necessary functionality.

Here are the required changes:

bank_account.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
=======
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <mutex>
#include <cstdint>

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {
public:
    Bankaccount();
    void open();
    void close();
    void deposit(std::int64_t amount);
    void withdraw(std::int64_t amount);
    std::int64_t balance() const;
    
private:
    mutable std::mutex mtx;
    std::int64_t current_balance;
    bool is_open;
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the methods in bank_account.cpp:

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "bank_account.h"

namespace Bankaccount {}
=======
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : current_balance(0), is_open(false) {
}

void Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is already open");
    }
    is_open = true;
    current_balance = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is not open");
    }
    is_open = false;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    current_balance += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    if (amount > current_balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    current_balance -= amount;
}

std::int64_t Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    return current_balance;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. All operations are synchronized using a mutex to prevent race conditions
2. The account must be open to perform operations
3. We check for valid amounts (positive values)
4. We check for sufficient funds when withdrawing
5. The balance() function also checks if the account is open
6. We use std::lock_guard to ensure the mutex is always properly released

This implementation ensures thread safety by locking the mutex during each operation, preventing race conditions when multiple threads access the account simultaneously. All operations will fail if the account is closed, which meets the requirements.

However, the interface needs to be precise:
- The class name is Bankaccount (not BankAccount)
- All operations are member functions
- We need to handle errors by throwing exceptions when operations are invalid

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
1. Thread-safe access to the account
2. Support for opening and closing accounts
3. Support for deposits and withdrawals
4. Proper error handling for invalid operations
5. Preventing operations on closed accounts

Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to ensure it meets the requirements. The key issue is that the implementation needs to be thread-safe and handle operations on closed accounts appropriately. Let's fix any potential issues:

1. The implementation needs to ensure that all operations on a closed account fail
2. We need to make sure all operations are properly synchronized
3. We need to handle the initial state correctly

However, the implementation looks correct. Let's see if there are any specific issues:
- The balance starts at 0 when opened
- All operations check if the account is open
- Mutex is used to synchronize access
- All operations throw exceptions when the account is closed

Wait, the instructions say that operations against a closed account must fail, which they do by throwing exceptions. This seems correct.

But perhaps the implementation needs to be more precise:
1. When opening, the balance should be set to 0
2. When closing, the account should be marked as closed
3. All operations should check if the account is open

Actually, the implementation seems to do all of these things correctly. Maybe there's an issue with the types or signatures?

Wait, the implementation uses std::int64_t which is a standard signed integer type, which violates the MISRA rule:
"The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used"

We need to use fixed-width types. But std::int64_t is a fixed-width type from <cstdint>, which is included. This seems correct.

Perhaps the issue is that the implementation needs to use a typedef/using alias:
"Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, etc."

But the implementation is already using std::int64_t which is a fixed-width type. Maybe the user wants us to create an alias.

Let's create a type alias for the amount type to comply with the rules:

Here are the necessary changes:

bank_account.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include <mutex>
#include <cstdint>

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {
public:
    Bankaccount();
    void open();
    void close();
    void deposit(std::int64_t amount);
    void withdraw(std::int64_t amount);
    std::int64_t balance() const;
    
private:
    mutable std::mutex mtx;
    std::int64_t current_balance;
    bool is_open;
};  // class Bankaccount
=======
#include <mutex>
#include <cstdint>

namespace Bankaccount {

using amount_t = std::int64_t;

class Bankaccount {
public:
    Bankaccount();
    void open();
    void close();
    void deposit(amount_t amount);
    void withdraw(amount_t amount);
    amount_t balance() const;
    
private:
    mutable std::mutex mtx;
    amount_t current_balance;
    bool is_open;
};  // class Bankaccount
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, update the implementation to use the alias:

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : current_balance(0), is_open(false) {

    if (is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is already open");
    }
    is_open = true;
    current_balance = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is not open");
    }
    is_open = false;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    current_balance += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    if (amount > current_balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    current_balance -= amount;
}

std::int64_t Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    return current_balance;
}
=======
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : current_balance(0), is_open(false) {
}

void Bankaccount::open() {

    }
    is_open = false;
}

    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    current_balance += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(amount_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    if (amount > current_balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    current_balance -= amount;
}

amount_t Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    return current_balance;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change introduces a type alias `amount_t` which is set to `std::int64_t`, which should comply with the MISRA rule about not using standard integer types directly. All function signatures now use this alias instead of directly using `std::int64_t`.

This implementation should now:
1. Be thread-safe through proper use of mutex
2. Prevent operations on closed accounts by throwing exceptions
3. Validate deposit and withdrawal amounts
4. Check for sufficient funds before allowing withdrawals
5. Use appropriate fixed-width integer types through an alias

This should address any potential issues while maintaining the required functionality. Let me know if there are further adjustments needed.

I understand. The issue is that we're using `std::int64_t` directly, which violates the MISRA rule about not using standard integer types. Instead, we need to use fixed-width types through a typedef/using alias. But we're already doing that with `amount_t = std::int64_t`, which should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the rule wants us to never use the standard integer types at all, even in aliases. But that doesn't make sense because fixed-width types like `std::int64_t` are typedefs themselves to standard integer types.

Actually, the rule says:
"The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used"
This means we shouldn't use types like 'int', 'long', etc. directly. But `std::int64_t` is from <cstdint> and is a fixed-width type, which is allowed.

Perhaps the issue is that the implementation needs to be more precise about the types. Let's make sure we're always using the fixed-width types through our alias.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the user wants to see the exact type being used, or there's another issue.

Actually, the implementation seems correct. Let's make sure all operations are properly synchronized and handle edge cases:
1. The account starts closed
2. Opening sets balance to 0 and marks as open
3. All operations check if the account is open
4. Deposits and withdrawals must be positive
5. Withdrawals must not exceed the balance
6. All operations are thread-safe using a mutex

This implementation seems to do all of that. Perhaps there's an issue with exception messages or something else.

Wait, the instructions say "operations against a closed account must fail" - they don't specify how. Throwing exceptions is a valid way to fail.

Perhaps the implementation needs to be adjusted to not throw on certain operations. Let's re-read the requirements:
1. It should be possible to close an account
2. Operations against a closed account must fail

This is vague, but throwing exceptions seems appropriate.

Since I can't see any actual errors, I'll assume the implementation is correct. If there are specific test cases failing, I'd need to know what they are to fix them.

However, to be thorough, let's make sure all operations are properly synchronized and that we're using the mutex correctly:
1. All member functions that modify state should lock the mutex
2. The balance() function should also lock the mutex since it reads state that can be modified
3. The mutex is mutable to allow locking in const member functions

This seems correct in the implementation.

Since the implementation appears to be correct and follows the requirements, I'll provide it as is. If there are specific issues, please let me know.
