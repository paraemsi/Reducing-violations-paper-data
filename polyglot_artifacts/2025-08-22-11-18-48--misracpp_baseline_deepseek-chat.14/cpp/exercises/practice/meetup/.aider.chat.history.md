#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Every month, your partner meets up with their best friend.  
#### Both of them have very busy schedules, making it challenging to find a suitable date!  
#### Given your own busy schedule, your partner always double-checks potential meetup dates with you:  
####   
#### - "Can I meet up on the first Friday of next month?"  
#### - "What about the third Wednesday?"  
#### - "Maybe the last Sunday?"  
####   
#### In this month's call, your partner asked you this question:  
####   
#### - "I'd like to meet up on the teenth Thursday; is that okay?"  
####   
#### Confused, you ask what a "teenth" day is.  
#### Your partner explains that a teenth day, a concept they made up, refers to the days in a month that end in '-teenth':  
####   
#### - 13th (thirteenth)  
#### - 14th (fourteenth)  
#### - 15th (fifteenth)  
#### - 16th (sixteenth)  
#### - 17th (seventeenth)  
#### - 18th (eighteenth)  
#### - 19th (nineteenth)  
####   
#### As there are also seven weekdays, it is guaranteed that each day of the week has _exactly one_ teenth day each month.  
####   
#### Now that you understand the concept of a teenth day, you check your calendar.  
#### You don't have anything planned on the teenth Thursday, so you happily confirm the date with your partner.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to find the exact date of a meetup, given a month, year, weekday and week.  
####   
#### There are five week values to consider: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, `last`, `teenth`.  
####   
#### For example, you might be asked to find the date for the meetup on the first Monday in January 2018 (January 1, 2018).  
####   
#### Similarly, you might be asked to find:  
####   
#### - the third Tuesday of August 2019 (August 20, 2019)  
#### - the teenth Wednesday of May 2020 (May 13, 2020)  
#### - the fourth Sunday of July 2021 (July 25, 2021)  
#### - the last Thursday of November 2022 (November 24, 2022)  
#### - the teenth Saturday of August 1953 (August 15, 1953)  
####   
#### ## Teenth  
####   
#### The teenth week refers to the seven days in a month that end in '-teenth' (13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th).  
####   
#### If asked to find the teenth Saturday of August, 1953, we check its calendar:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
####     August 1953  
#### Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
####                    1  
####  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  
####  9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
#### 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  
#### 23 24 25 26 27 28 29  
#### 30 31  
#### ```  
####   
#### From this we find that the teenth Saturday is August 15, 1953.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: meetup.cpp meetup.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I understand. We need to implement a function that can find the exact date for a meetup based on the year, month, weekday, and week specification. Let's think about how to approach this.

Since the function signature isn't provided, I'll need to add it to the header and implementation files. Let's assume it's something like:
boost::gregorian::date meetup(int year, int month, const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday)

However, since the instructions don't specify, I'll need to be careful. Let's use the standard C++ library.

Wait, C++ doesn't have built-in date handling until C++20, which may not be available. So we need to use another approach.
But the instructions don't specify which libraries to use, so we need to be careful.

Actually, since this is a coding exercise, we can use the boost library, but the instructions say to use standard libraries.
So we need to implement our own date logic.

Let's implement a function that can find the day of the week for any date, and then find the appropriate date that matches the criteria.

First, let's add the function signature to the header file:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

namespace meetup {

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
=======
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <string>

namespace meetup {

class scheduler {
public:
    scheduler(int year, int month);
    int find_day(const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday) const;
    
private:
    int year_;
    int month_;
    int day_of_week(int day) const;
    int days_in_month() const;
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the functionality in meetup.cpp. We need to find the day of the week for a given date.
We can use Zeller's Congruence or another algorithm to find the day of the week.

Wait, the instructions say to find the exact date, so we need to return a date, not just a day number.
But the function signature in the header suggests returning an int, which may not be correct.
But since the tests may expect a certain interface, we need to be careful.

Actually, the tests may be using a specific interface, but since they're not provided, we need to make assumptions.
Let's implement a function that can find the day number that matches the criteria.

Here's an implementation:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "meetup.h"

namespace meetup {

}  // namespace meetup
=======
#include "meetup.h"
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <functional>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

namespace meetup {

scheduler::scheduler(int year, int month) : year_(year), month_(month) {}

int scheduler::find_day(const string& week, const string& weekday) const {
    // Map weekdays to numbers (0-6, Sunday=0)
    map<string, int> weekday_map {
        {"Sunday", 0}, {"Monday", 1}, {"Tuesday", 2}, {"Wednesday", 3},
        {"Thursday", 4}, {"Friday", 5}, {"Saturday", 6}
    };
    
    // Map week specifiers to functions that find the appropriate day
    int target_weekday = weekday_map.at(weekday);
    
    if (week == "teenth") {
        // Check days 13-19
        for (int day = 13; day <= 19; day++) {
            if (day_of_week(day) == target_weekday) {
                return day;
            }
        }
    } else {
        // For first, second, third, fourth, last
        vector<int> days;
        // Find all days in the month that match the target weekday
        int days_in_month = this->days_in_month();
        for (int day = 1; day <= days_in_month; day++) {
            if (day_of_week(day) == target_weekday) {
                days.push_back(day);
            }
        }
        
        if (week == "first") return days[0];
        if (week == "second") return days[1];
        if (week == "third") return days[2];
        if (week == "fourth") return days[3];
        if (week == "last") return days.back();
    }
    throw runtime_error("Invalid week specification");
}

int scheduler::day_of_week(int day) const {
    // Using Zeller's Congruence
    int m = month_;
    int y = year_;
    if (m < 3) {
        m += 12;
        y -= 1;
    }
    int K = y % 100;
    int J = y / 100;
    int h = (day + (13*(m + 1))/5 + K + (K/4) + (J/4) + 5*J);
    h = h % 7;
    // Adjust to have Sunday=0 to Saturday=6
    return (h + 6) % 7;
}

int scheduler::days_in_month() const {
    vector<int> days {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
    // Adjust for leap year in February
    if (month_ == 2) {
        bool is_leap = (year_ % 4 == 0 && (year_ % 100 != 0 || year_ % 400 == 0));
        return is_leap ? 29 : 28;
    }
    return days[month_ - 1];
}

}  // namespace meetup
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue: the interface may not match what the tests expect. Since the tests aren't provided, we need to make educated guesses.
The implementation above provides a class-based approach which may not be what's expected, but it's a reasonable way to organize the functionality.

Wait, the instructions may expect a function that directly returns a date. But since the original files were empty, we need to be flexible.
If the tests don't pass, we may need to adjust the interface.

This implementation should handle:
1. Finding the day of the week for any date in the month
2. Handling leap years correctly
3. Finding the appropriate day based on the week specification (first, second, etc.)
4. Handling teenth days correctly by checking the 13th-19th of the month

However, the implementation uses Zeller's Congruence which is reliable for the Gregorian calendar, which should be fine for the given years.

Let's hope this implementation meets the requirements. If there are issues with the interface, we may need to adjust it.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to match what the tests expect. Since the tests are not provided, we need to make sure our implementation is correct and follows the typical patterns for such problems.

However, the implementation seems to be using a class-based approach, but the tests might be expecting a function that directly returns the date. Let's think about the typical interface for meetup problems:
It's common to have a function that takes year, month, week, and weekday and returns a date.

Wait, the header file shows a class called `scheduler`, which suggests that the tests might be using this interface.
But the implementation needs to be correct.

Let's fix potential issues:
1. The day_of_week calculation might be off
2. The ordering of days needs to be correct
3. The week specification needs to be handled correctly

Wait, Zeller's Congruence uses:
h = (q + floor(13*(m+1)/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) - 2*J) mod 7
where:
q is the day of the month
m is the month (3=March, 4=April, ..., 14=February)
K the year of the century (year mod 100)
J is the zero-based century (year // 100)

And it gives:
0=Saturday, 1=Sunday, 2=Monday, ..., 6=Friday

But we want Sunday=0 to Saturday=6
So we can adjust by adding 6 mod 7: (h + 6) % 7

Wait, the implementation uses:
(day + (13*(m + 1))/5 + K + (K/4) + (J/4) + 5*J)
This seems to be missing some parts and using integer division which may not be correct.

Let's fix the implementation:

Here are the necessary fixes:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
int scheduler::day_of_week(int day) const {
    // Using Zeller's Congruence
    int m = month_;
    int y = year_;
    if (m < 3) {
        m += 12;
        y -= 1;
    }
    int K = y % 100;
    int J = y / 100;
    int h = (day + (13*(m + 1))/5 + K + (K/4) + (J/4) + 5*J);
    h = h % 7;
    // Adjust to have Sunday=0 to Saturday=6
    return (h + 6) % 7;
}
=======
int scheduler::day_of_week(int day) const {
    // Using Zeller's Congruence
    int m = month_;
    int y = year_;
    if (m < 3) {
        m += 12;
        y -= 1;
    }
    int q = day;
    int K = y % 100;
    int J = y / 100;
    int h = q + 13*(m+1)/5 + K + K/4 + J/4 + 5*J;
    h = h % 7;
    // Convert to Sunday=0 to Saturday=6
    // Zeller's gives: 0=Saturday, 1=Sunday, 2=Monday, ... 6=Friday
    // So we can map 1->0, 2->1, ..., 6->5, 0->6
    // Let's adjust:
    int day_of_week = (h + 5) % 7;
    return day_of_week;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, this may still not be correct. Let's test our implementation with a known date:
January 1, 2000 was a Saturday
According to our mapping, Saturday should be 6
Let's compute:
m = 13 (since January is treated as month 13 of previous year)
y = 1999
q = 1
K = 99
J = 19
h = 1 + 13*(13+1)/5 + 99 + 99/4 + 19/4 + 5*19
Compute step by step:
13*14=182 → 182/5=36 (integer division)
99/4=24
19/4=4
5*19=95
h = 1 + 36 + 99 + 24 + 4 + 95 = 259
259 % 7 = 0
(0 + 5) % 7 = 5
But we want 6 for Saturday
Wait, our mapping needs to be adjusted.

Actually, Zeller's Congruence gives:
0=Saturday, 1=Sunday, 2=Monday, etc.
So to get Sunday=0, Monday=1, etc., we can use (h + 6) % 7
0 -> 6 (Saturday)
1 -> 0 (Sunday)
2 -> 1 (Monday)
...
6 -> 5 (Friday)
But we want Saturday to be 6, which matches
So it's correct:
(0 + 6) % 7 =6 → Saturday
(1 + 6) % 7 =0 → Sunday
etc.

Wait, the initial implementation had (h + 6) % 7 which seems correct
Let's revert that part:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    int day_of_week = (h + 5) % 7;
    return day_of_week;
=======
    // Adjust to have Sunday=0 to Saturday=6
    return (h + 6) % 7;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, the implementation should be correct. Let's test January 1, 2000:
h=0
(0 + 6) % 7 =6 → which matches Saturday=6 in our weekday_map

This seems correct.

Also, the implementation needs to ensure that integer divisions are flooring, which they are in C++ when using integers.

This implementation should now work correctly. Let's also make sure all week specifications are handled properly:
1. 'teenth' - check days 13-19
2. 'first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth' - index into the list of matching weekdays
3. 'last' - take the last element

This seems correct in the implementation.

However, if there are any issues with the tests, we may need to adjust further. Let's proceed with these fixes.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in meetup.cpp meetup.h to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests expect methods like `monteenth()`, `tuesteenth()`, etc. which return dates, not a `find_day` method. Let's fix the implementation to match the test expectations.

Since the tests are using Boost, we should use the Boost.Date_Time library to handle dates. Let's modify the implementation:

Here are the necessary changes:

meetup.h
```cpp

    int month_;
    int day_of_week(int day) const;
    int days_in_month() const;
};

I understand. The issue is that the implementation is using `boost::gregorian::greg_weekday` which is a type, but we need to use the actual weekday objects from the boost::gregorian namespace. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

meetup.cpp
```cpp

    for (int day = 13; day <= 19; day++) {
        date d(year_, month_, day);
        if (d.day_of_week() == weekday) {
            return d;
        }
    }
    throw std::runtime_error("Teenth day not found");
}

date scheduler::find_nth_day(int nth, greg_weekday weekday) const {
    // Start from the first day of the month
    date d(year_, month_, 1);
    // Find the first occurrence of the weekday
    while (d.day_of_week() != weekday) {
        d += days(1);
    }
    // Add (nth-1) weeks
    return d + weeks(nth - 1);
}

date scheduler::find_last_day(greg_weekday weekday) const {
    // Start from the last day of the month
    date d(year_, month_, gregorian_calendar::end_of_month_day(year_, month_));
    // Go backwards until we find the weekday
    while (d.day_of_week() != weekday) {
        d -= days(1);
    }
    return d;
}

This change ensures that we're using the actual weekday objects from the boost::gregorian namespace (like `boost::gregorian::Monday`, `boost::gregorian::Tuesday`, etc.) which are of type `greg_weekday`. This should now match the implementation and resolve any compilation errors.

I understand. The issue is that the macros are trying to use `boost::gregorian::Monday` etc., which are not valid. We need to use the actual `greg_weekday` objects. Let's fix this by using the correct way to create weekday objects.

This change uses numeric values to construct `greg_weekday` objects, where:
- 0 = Sunday
- 1 = Monday
- 2 = Tuesday
- 3 = Wednesday
- 4 = Thursday
- 5 = Friday
- 6 = Saturday

This should now compile correctly and match the expected behavior. Let's hope this resolves the issues.

I understand. The issue is that the implementation may be using the wrong day numbers. In Boost.Gregorian, the days of the week might be numbered differently. Let's fix that by using the actual day names from the boost::gregorian namespace directly.

This change uses the actual weekday objects from the boost::gregorian namespace by calling their default constructors (e.g., `Monday()`, `Tuesday()`, etc.). These are of type `greg_weekday`, which matches what our helper functions expect.

This should now correctly find the dates based on the day of the week. Let's hope this resolves the issues.
