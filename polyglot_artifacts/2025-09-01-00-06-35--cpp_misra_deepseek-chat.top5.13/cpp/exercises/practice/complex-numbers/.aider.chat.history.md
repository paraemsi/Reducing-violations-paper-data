#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.  
####   
#### `a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.  
#### The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.  
#### The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.  
####   
#### The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:  
#### `(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,  
#### `(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.  
####   
#### Multiplication result is by definition  
#### `(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.  
####   
#### The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is  
#### `1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:  
#### `(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Raising e to a complex exponent can be expressed as `e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`, the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,  
#### - conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.  
####   
#### Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: complex_numbers.cpp complex_numbers.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I'll implement a complex number class with the required operations. Let's start by defining the Complex class in the header file and then implement its methods in the source file.

Since we need to use floating point numbers, we'll use double precision. Let's proceed:

First, let's update the header file to declare the Complex class and its operations:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    
    // Operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Other functions
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these methods in the source file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "complex_numbers.h"

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
#include "complex_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

Complex::Complex(double real, double imag) : real_(real), imag_(imag) {}

double Complex::real() const {
    return real_;
}

double Complex::imag() const {
    return imag_;
}

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ + other.real_), (imag_ + other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ - other.real_), (imag_ - other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}

Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_, -imag_);
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex(magnitude * std::cos(imag_), magnitude * std::sin(imag_));
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all operations follow the MISRA C++ rules. Let's check:

1. We're using double for floating point numbers, which is appropriate
2. All operations are properly parenthesized
3. No character types are being used inappropriately
4. All if/else statements would have braces, but there are none in this implementation
5. No integer types are being used, so we don't need to worry about fixed-width types

This implementation should work. Let's test the operations:
- Addition and subtraction are straightforward
- Multiplication and division follow the given formulas
- Absolute value uses the Pythagorean theorem
- Conjugate flips the sign of the imaginary part
- Exponential uses Euler's formula

This implementation should be correct. Let me know if you have any questions or if there are any issues.

I understand. The implementation needs to match the interface expected by the tests. The tests may be expecting certain member function names that don't match what I implemented. Let me fix that.

However, the provided implementation seems to have member functions that match the operations described in the instructions. Let's ensure the implementation matches the interface.

Wait, the instructions say "don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc." This suggests that the tests may be using different function names than what I implemented.

But the provided header file shows:
- real() and imag() member functions
- operator overloads for +, -, *, /
- abs(), conj(), exp() member functions

This matches what I implemented. So perhaps there are no issues.

However, the user says there are errors, so maybe there are other requirements. Let's make sure all operations are implemented correctly and follow the MISRA C++ rules.

Wait, the implementation uses floating point numbers which are fine, and all operations seem correct. Let's check if there are any issues with parentheses to follow the MISRA rules.

Looking at the implementation, all expressions seem to be properly parenthesized:
- Multiplication and division operations have explicit parentheses
- The absolute value calculation is properly parenthesized

Wait, the implementation of operator/ could be improved to be more precise:
Let's add more parentheses to ensure proper evaluation order according to MISRA rules.

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but let's add more parentheses to be sure:

Wait, the division implementation needs to ensure all operations are properly parenthesized:
((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) is already parenthesized
((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) is also parenthesized

But to be extra careful, let's add parentheses around each multiplication:
((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) → (((real_ * other.real_)) + ((imag_ * other.imag_)))
But this seems excessive.

Actually, the implementation seems to follow the rules:
- All binary operations have their operands properly parenthesized when they're part of larger expressions
- The order of operations is clear

Wait, the user may be referring to the fact that the tests expect certain things that aren't implemented. But the instructions say to implement:
- addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers
- conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number

All of these are implemented.

Perhaps the issue is that the tests are using a different interface. Let's make sure all operations are present.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Let's proceed to make sure all expressions are properly parenthesized according to MISRA rules.

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}
=======
Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_));
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_));
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = ((other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_));
    double real_part = (((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator);
    double imag_part = (((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt(((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_)));
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This adds extra parentheses to ensure all operations are explicitly grouped, which follows the MISRA rule about using parentheses to indicate precedence.

However, this may not be the actual issue. If there are other problems, please provide more specific information about the errors.

#### Fix the code in complex_numbers.cpp complex_numbers.h to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests are trying to perform operations between Complex numbers and doubles, but we only implemented operations between Complex numbers. We need to add these additional operators.

Let's add non-member operators to handle cases where doubles are on either side of the operation. Since a double can be treated as a complex number with zero imaginary part, we can implement these operators.

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    
    // Operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Other functions
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    
    // Operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Other functions
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
};

// Non-member operators to handle double on the left side
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these non-member operators in the .cpp file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex(magnitude * std::cos(imag_), magnitude * std::sin(imag_));
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex(magnitude * std::cos(imag_), magnitude * std::sin(imag_));
}

// Implement non-member operators
namespace complex_numbers {

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs + rhs.real(), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs - rhs.real(), -rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs * rhs.real(), lhs * rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To divide a real number by a complex number, we can treat the real number as a complex number
    // with zero imaginary part and use the division formula
    double denominator = ((rhs.real() * rhs.real()) + (rhs.imag() * rhs.imag()));
    double real_part = ((lhs * rhs.real()) / denominator);
    double imag_part = (((-lhs) * rhs.imag()) / denominator);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, the tests also expect to be able to add doubles on the right side, which are currently handled by the member operators. But the error messages show that the member operators only take Complex references, not doubles. So we need to add additional member operators that can handle doubles, or make sure doubles can be implicitly converted.

Wait, the tests show:
c + 5.0 → This should use a member operator+ that can handle doubles
But our implementation only has operator+(const Complex&)

To fix this, we need to add overloaded operators that can handle doubles directly. Let's add these to the class:

Wait, but adding them as member functions would be better. Let's add them to the class declaration:

Wait, but the tests may be using both:
complex + double
double + complex

We've added non-member operators for double + complex, but we also need to handle complex + double
Let's add member operators to handle these cases:

Wait, let's add these to the class:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    // Operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
=======
    // Operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator+(double other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(double other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(double other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(double other) const;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now implement these in the .cpp file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ + other.real_), (imag_ + other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ - other.real_), (imag_ - other.imag_));
}
=======
Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ + other.real_), (imag_ + other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator+(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ + other), imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ - other.real_), (imag_ - other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator-(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ - other), imag_);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_));
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_));
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = ((other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_));
    double real_part = (((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator);
    double imag_part = (((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
=======
Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_));
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_));
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ * other), (imag_ * other));
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = ((other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_));
    double real_part = (((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator);
    double imag_part = (((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ / other), (imag_ / other));
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This should now handle all the cases where doubles are used with complex numbers in various operations. Let's hope this resolves all the test errors.

I see the issue. The non-member operator functions are being defined within the `complex_numbers` namespace twice, which is causing a redefinition. Let's fix that by removing the nested namespace block in the implementation file.

Here are the necessary fixes:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Implement non-member operators
namespace complex_numbers {

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs + rhs.real(), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs - rhs.real(), -rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs * rhs.real(), lhs * rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To divide a real number by a complex number, we can treat the real number as a complex number
    // with zero imaginary part and use the division formula
    double denominator = ((rhs.real() * rhs.real()) + (rhs.imag() * rhs.imag()));
    double real_part = ((lhs * rhs.real()) / denominator);
    double imag_part = (((-lhs) * rhs.imag()) / denominator);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
// Implement non-member operators (they're already in the complex_numbers namespace)
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs + rhs.real(), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs - rhs.real(), -rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs * rhs.real(), lhs * rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To divide a real number by a complex number, we can treat the real number as a complex number
    // with zero imaginary part and use the division formula
    double denominator = ((rhs.real() * rhs.real()) + (rhs.imag() * rhs.imag()));
    double real_part = ((lhs * rhs.real()) / denominator);
    double imag_part = (((-lhs) * rhs.imag()) / denominator);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change removes the nested namespace block which was causing the redefinition, while keeping the operators in the correct namespace (since we're already within the `complex_numbers` namespace).

Also, let's make sure all expressions are properly parenthesized according to MISRA rules:

Wait, all expressions seem to be properly parenthesized:
- All binary operations have their operands properly grouped
- The order of operations is clear

This should now compile without errors. The implementation provides:
1. Member operators for complex + double, etc.
2. Non-member operators for double + complex, etc.
3. All required complex number operations

Let's hope this resolves the compilation issues.

I understand. The issue is that the implementation is missing a closing brace for the namespace. Let's fix that by adding the missing closing brace at the end of the file.

Here's the fix:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To divide a real number by a complex number, we can treat the real number as a complex number
    // with zero imaginary part and use the division formula
    double denominator = ((rhs.real() * rhs.real()) + (rhs.imag() * rhs.imag()));
    double real_part = ((lhs * rhs.real()) / denominator);
    double imag_part = (((-lhs) * rhs.imag()) / denominator);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
=======
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To divide a real number by a complex number, we can treat the real number as a complex number
    // with zero imaginary part and use the division formula
    double denominator = ((rhs.real() * rhs.real()) + (rhs.imag() * rhs.imag()));
    double real_part = ((lhs * rhs.real()) / denominator);
    double imag_part = (((-lhs) * rhs.imag()) / denominator);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This adds the missing closing brace for the `complex_numbers` namespace. This should resolve any compilation errors related to the namespace not being properly closed.
