#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a clock that handles times without dates.  
####   
#### You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.  
####   
#### Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.cpp clock.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. Let's implement a clock that handles times without dates, allowing addition and subtraction of minutes, and ensuring that two clocks representing the same time are equal.

Since we need to use fixed-width integer types, we'll include <cstdint>. We'll represent the time in minutes since midnight (0-1439) and provide methods to add and subtract minutes, while normalizing the time to always be within this range.

However, the instructions don't specify the exact interface, but typically, we'd need:
1. A Clock class
2. Methods to add and subtract minutes
3. Equality comparison
4. A way to create clocks at specific hours and minutes

Since the namespace is provided, we'll implement within that.

Let's start by defining the Clock class in the header:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
=======
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

namespace date_independent {
    class clock {
    private:
        std::int32_t minutes;
        explicit clock(std::int32_t total_minutes);
        
    public:
        static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
        clock plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const;
        clock minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const;
        operator std::string() const;
        bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
        bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;
    };
}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the methods in clock.cpp:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {
    clock::clock(std::int32_t total_minutes) {
        // Normalize to be within 0-1439
        total_minutes %= 1440;
        if (total_minutes < 0) {
            total_minutes += 1440;
        }
        minutes = total_minutes;
    }

    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        return clock(total_minutes);
    }

    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const {
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (minutes + minutes_to_add) % 1440;
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }

    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const {
        return this->plus(-minutes_to_subtract);
    }

    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = minutes / 60;
        std::int32_t mins = minutes % 60;
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
        return oss.str();
    }

    bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
        return minutes == other.minutes;
    }

    bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
        return !(*this == other);
    }
}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The implementation uses modulo arithmetic to handle wrapping around midnight
2. We need to ensure negative values are handled correctly by adding 1440 minutes (24 hours)
3. The time is always normalized to be between 00:00 and 23:59
4. The string conversion uses leading zeros for both hours and minutes
5. We've added operator== and operator!= for comparison

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
1. Add and subtract minutes: done via plus() and minus() methods
2. Handle times without dates: we only store minutes since midnight
3. Two clocks representing the same time are equal: ensured by comparing the normalized minute values

However, the instructions don't specify exact method signatures, so we need to be careful. If the tests expect different interfaces, we may need to adjust. Let's proceed with this implementation.

I notice that the implementation needs to be adjusted to handle the normalization correctly. The current implementation may have issues with very large numbers due to integer overflow. Let's fix that by always normalizing using modulo arithmetic.

However, the main issue is that the implementation needs to ensure that the time is always valid. Let's fix the implementation to handle all cases correctly.

Here are the necessary fixes:

1. The plus and minus operations need to handle large numbers correctly
2. The normalization should always produce a value between 0 and 1439
3. The implementation needs to be robust

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    clock::clock(std::int32_t total_minutes) {
        // Normalize to be within 0-1439
        total_minutes %= 1440;
        if (total_minutes < 0) {
            total_minutes += 1440;
        }
        minutes = total_minutes;
    }

    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        return clock(total_minutes);
    }

    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const {
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (minutes + minutes_to_add) % 1440;
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }

    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const {
        return this->plus(-minutes_to_subtract);
    }

    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = minutes / 60;
        std::int32_t mins = minutes % 60;
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
        return oss.str();
    }
=======
    clock::clock(std::int32_t total_minutes) {
        // Normalize to be within 0-1439
        // Handle negative values by adding enough days to make it positive
        if (total_minutes < 0) {
            total_minutes %= 1440;
            total_minutes += 1440;
        }
        // Handle positive values
        minutes = total_minutes % 1440;
        // Ensure it's positive (modulo of negative numbers can be tricky)
        if (minutes < 0) {
            minutes += 1440;
        }
    }

    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        // Convert hours to minutes and add
        std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        return clock(total_minutes);
    }

    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const {
        // Add minutes and normalize
        std::int32_t new_minutes = minutes + minutes_to_add;
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }

    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const {
        // Subtract minutes by adding negative
        return this->plus(-minutes_to_subtract);
    }

    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = minutes / 60;
        std::int32_t mins = minutes % 60;
        // Handle hours that might be 24 or more (but they shouldn't be due to normalization)
        hours %= 24;
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
        return oss.str();
    }

```

However, there's a potential issue with integer overflow when adding very large numbers. But since we're using 32-bit integers, and the maximum number of minutes in a day is 1440, and the number of minutes we can add or subtract can be up to ~2 billion, which fits in 32 bits, we're okay.

Wait, but 2,000,000,000 minutes is about 3805 years, which when normalized to minutes per day (1440) will fit within our approach.

This implementation should now handle all cases correctly:
1. Adding and subtracting minutes
2. Normalizing times to always be valid
3. Comparing clocks for equality
4. Converting to string with proper formatting

Let's also make sure the hours are always between 0 and 23 by using modulo 24 when formatting the string.
