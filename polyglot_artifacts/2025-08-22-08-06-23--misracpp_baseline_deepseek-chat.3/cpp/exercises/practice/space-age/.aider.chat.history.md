#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: space_age.cpp space_age.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I understand. We need to create a class that can calculate someone's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the age is given in seconds, and each planet's year is defined relative to Earth years, we can first calculate the age in Earth years, and then divide by the orbital period to get the planet-specific age.

First, we need to define a class in the header file that can store the age in seconds and provide methods to get the age on each planet.

Wait, the instructions say not to change existing functions or classes, but the namespace is empty. So we need to add a class within the namespace.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a class `space_age` that takes seconds in its constructor
2. Add methods for each planet to calculate the age
3. The Earth year in seconds is 31557600
4. For other planets, divide the Earth years by their orbital period

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    long long age_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(long long seconds);
    long long seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation in space_age.cpp:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_seconds / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return on_earth() / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return on_earth() / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return on_earth() / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should work by first calculating the age in Earth years, and then dividing by each planet's orbital period to get the age on that planet. Since the orbital periods are relative to Earth years, this approach makes sense.

However, to ensure precision, we're using floating point division. The `seconds()` method just returns the stored seconds, which matches the interface that might be expected from tests.

Let's test this with the provided example:
1,000,000,000 seconds should be 31.69 Earth years
Which matches: 1,000,000,000 / 31,557,600 ≈ 31.688

Wait, the note says 31,557,600 seconds per Earth year, which matches our implementation:
31557600.0 in the code

This implementation should be correct. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to be precise to pass tests. Let's ensure all calculations are accurate. The issue might be with floating point precision or the order of operations.

Wait, the age on other planets should be the number of Earth years divided by their orbital period, which matches our implementation. But perhaps the tests expect a certain precision.

Actually, the problem might be that we need to use the exact values provided, and ensure we're using precise floating point operations.

But the implementation seems correct. Let's make sure we're using the right number of seconds per Earth year: 365.25 days/year * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute
365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60 = 31557600 exactly, which matches our implementation.

Wait, the instructions say:
"One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds" which matches.

Perhaps the issue is that the tests expect the seconds() method to return the exact number of seconds passed to the constructor, which it does.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Maybe there are no errors, and the markers are just indicating the lines to focus on.

But to be thorough, let's make sure all calculations are precise by using the exact values from the table and ensuring proper floating point division.

Actually, let's precompute the orbital periods in terms of seconds to avoid potential precision issues from multiple divisions:
age on planet = seconds / (earth_seconds_per_year * orbital_period)

But this is the same as (seconds / earth_seconds_per_year) / orbital_period, which is what we're doing.

Wait, perhaps the tests want the age to be precise to two decimal places, but the return type is double which should be fine.

Since the implementation seems correct, and the markers may just be highlighting, I won't change anything unless there are specific errors mentioned.

However, to be safe, let's use more precise calculations by directly computing each planet's age without chaining through on_earth() to avoid potential floating point error accumulation.

Wait, but that's not necessary as floating point errors should be minimal.

Actually, let's implement it directly to be precise:

Wait, but the implementation is correct. Let's see:

Perhaps the issue is that the seconds() method needs to be implemented to return the stored seconds, which it does.

Since there are no specific errors mentioned, I'll assume the implementation is correct and the markers are just for reference.

However, to ensure maximum precision, let's compute each planet's age using their orbital period in seconds:
Orbital period in seconds = orbital_period * 31557600.0
Then age on planet = seconds / (orbital_period * 31557600.0)

But this is the same as on_earth() / orbital_period, which is what we have.

So our implementation is mathematically correct.

Since there are no specific errors to fix, I'll leave the implementation as is.
