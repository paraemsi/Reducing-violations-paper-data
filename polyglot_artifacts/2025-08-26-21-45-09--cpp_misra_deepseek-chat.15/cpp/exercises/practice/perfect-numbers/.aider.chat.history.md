#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of [perfect](#perfect), [abundant](#abundant), or [deficient](#deficient) based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The _aliquot sum_ is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of `15` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.  
####   
#### ## Perfect  
####   
#### A number is perfect when it equals its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `6` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`  
#### - `28` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`  
####   
#### ## Abundant  
####   
#### A number is abundant when it is less than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `12` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
#### - `24` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36`  
####   
#### ## Deficient  
####   
#### A number is deficient when it is greater than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `8` is a deficient number because `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`  
#### - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is [perfect](#perfect).  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is [abundant](#abundant) or [deficient](#deficient).

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: perfect_numbers.cpp perfect_numbers.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. We need to implement a classification function that determines if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on its aliquot sum. Let's implement this.

Since we need to include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types, we'll need to modify the headers accordingly. Let's implement a function that takes a number and returns its classification.

However, the instructions don't specify the exact function signature, but since this is C++, we'll need to define an enum or similar to represent the classification types.

Wait, the files provided are empty namespaces, so we need to add our implementation. Let's define an enumeration for the classification and a function to determine the classification.

Here's the plan:
1. Add an enum class to represent the classification
2. Implement a function that calculates the aliquot sum and returns the appropriate classification
3. Make sure to handle edge cases (like numbers less than 1)

Since the number can be positive, and we need to handle factors, we'll need to be efficient.
Let's implement this:

Wait, the number can be up to 1,000,000 or more? We need to be efficient in finding factors.
We can find all factors up to sqrt(n) to be efficient.

Here are the necessary changes:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int64_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the classify function in perfect_numbers.cpp:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 separately, as it has no proper divisors other than possibly itself
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to include <stdexcept> for std::domain_error
2. We need to include <cmath> for std::sqrt
3. We need to handle numbers that are perfect squares to avoid adding the same factor twice
4. We need to ensure that the number itself is not included in the sum (which it won't be, since our loop only goes up to sqrt(n) and we're adding divisors less than number)

Wait, the aliquot sum is the sum of proper divisors, which are divisors excluding the number itself. Since our implementation never adds the number itself, it's correct.

This implementation should work efficiently for numbers up to reasonably large values. Let's test the cases:
- 6: divisors are 1, 2, 3 → sum=6 → perfect
- 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 → sum=28 → perfect
- 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → sum=16 → abundant
- 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 → sum=36 → abundant
- 8: 1, 2, 4 → sum=7 → deficient
- Prime numbers: only divisor is 1 → sum=1 → deficient

This matches the examples provided. Let's proceed with this implementation.

I understand. The issue might be with the implementation not matching the expected interface. Let me think about what could be wrong.

Since the exercise mentions that we shouldn't change existing function names, and the implementation may be tested against specific expectations, perhaps the test expects a different return type or the enum values to be in a specific order.

Wait, the implementation looks correct, but let's make sure:
1. The number must be positive, which we check
2. We need to handle edge cases properly
3. The classification enum values match the expected ones

However, the implementation might be too slow for very large numbers, but that's probably not the issue here.

Wait, the problem might be that the number can be very large, and using floating point sqrt could introduce precision issues when converting to integer. Let's fix that by using integer math to find the square root.

Wait, another approach is to loop up to number/2, but that's less efficient. Let's stick with the efficient approach but make sure it's precise.

Actually, to avoid precision issues with std::sqrt, we can use i*i <= number condition:
But this may be slower, but more precise.

Wait, let's fix that:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 separately, as it has no proper divisors other than possibly itself
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1;
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i * i <= number; ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation avoids using floating point math which could cause precision issues for large numbers. Now, it uses integer math to find factors up to the square root of the number.

However, there's another potential issue: the number could be very large, and i*i could overflow. But since number is a 64-bit integer, and i is up to around 4.3 billion which fits in 32 bits, and i*i fits in 64 bits, this should be fine on most platforms.

This implementation should now be more robust. Let's hope this fixes any issues.
