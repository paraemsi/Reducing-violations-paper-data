#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Clean up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.  
####   
#### The **North American Numbering Plan (NANP)** is a telephone numbering system used by many countries in North America like the United States, Canada or Bermuda.  
#### All NANP-countries share the same international country code: `1`.  
####   
#### NANP numbers are ten-digit numbers consisting of a three-digit Numbering Plan Area code, commonly known as _area code_, followed by a seven-digit local number.  
#### The first three digits of the local number represent the _exchange code_, followed by the unique four-digit number which is the _subscriber number_.  
####   
#### The format is usually represented as  
####   
#### ```text  
#### NXX NXX-XXXX  
#### ```  
####   
#### where `N` is any digit from 2 through 9 and `X` is any digit from 0 through 9.  
####   
#### Sometimes they also have the country code (represented as `1` or `+1`) prefixed.  
####   
#### Your task is to clean up differently formatted telephone numbers by removing punctuation and the country code if present.  
####   
#### For example, the inputs  
####   
#### - `+1 (613)-995-0253`  
#### - `613-995-0253`  
#### - `1 613 995 0253`  
#### - `613.995.0253`  
####   
#### should all produce the output  
####   
#### `6139950253`  
####   
#### **Note:** As this exercise only deals with telephone numbers used in NANP-countries, only 1 is considered a valid country code.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: phone_number.h phone_number.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a function to clean up phone numbers according to the NANP format. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the function needs to be in the phone_number namespace, and we need to process the input string to extract a valid NANP number, we'll need to:
1. Remove all non-digit characters
2. Check if the number has a country code '1' prefix and remove it
3. Validate the resulting number to ensure it matches NANP format

However, the function signature isn't specified, so we need to be careful. Since this is C++, we'll probably want to implement a class or function that takes a string and returns a cleaned number, or throws an exception for invalid numbers.

Wait, the files show empty namespaces, so we need to add our implementation. Let's add a function to clean the number.

Since the instructions don't specify the exact function signature, but mention it's used by unit tests, we'll need to be careful. Let's assume it's a function that takes a string and returns a string.

Here's the plan:
1. Remove all non-digit characters from the input
2. Check the length:
   If it's 11 digits, the first must be '1', then take the next 10
   If it's 10 digits, use as is
   Otherwise, it's invalid
3. Validate the area code and exchange code:
   Area code (first 3 digits): N must be 2-9
   Exchange code (next 3 digits): N must be 2-9

Here are the necessary changes:

First, let's update the header file to declare the function:

phone_number.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PHONE_NUMBER_H)
#define PHONE_NUMBER_H

namespace phone_number {

}  // namespace phone_number

#endif // PHONE_NUMBER_H
=======
#if !defined(PHONE_NUMBER_H)
#define PHONE_NUMBER_H

#include <string>

namespace phone_number {

class phone_number {
public:
    explicit phone_number(const std::string& raw_number);
    std::string number() const;
    std::string area_code() const;
    operator std::string() const;
    
private:
    std::string cleaned_number;
};

}  // namespace phone_number

#endif // PHONE_NUMBER_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the functionality in the cpp file:

phone_number.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "phone_number.h"

namespace phone_number {

}  // namespace phone_number
=======
#include "phone_number.h"
#include <string>
#include <cctype>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace phone_number {

phone_number::phone_number(const std::string& raw_number) {
    // First, extract all digits
    std::string digits;
    for (char c : raw_number) {
        if (std::isdigit(c)) {
            digits.push_back(c);
        }
    }
    
    // Check length
    if (digits.length() == 11) {
        if (digits[0] != '1') {
            throw std::domain_error("Invalid country code");
        }
        // Remove the country code
        digits = digits.substr(1);
    }
    
    // Now check if we have exactly 10 digits
    if (digits.length() != 10) {
        throw std::domain_error("Invalid number of digits");
    }
    
    // Check area code (first digit of first 3 digits)
    if ((digits[0] < '2') || (digits[0] > '9')) {
        throw std::domain_error("Area code cannot start with 0 or 1");
    }
    
    // Check exchange code (first digit of next 3 digits)
    if ((digits[3] < '2') || (digits[3] > '9')) {
        throw std::domain_error("Exchange code cannot start with 0 or 1");
    }
    
    cleaned_number = digits;
}

std::string phone_number::number() const {
    return cleaned_number;
}

std::string phone_number::area_code() const {
    return cleaned_number.substr(0, 3);
}

phone_number::operator std::string() const {
    // Format as NXX NXX-XXXX
    return "(" + area_code() + ") " + cleaned_number.substr(3, 3) + "-" + cleaned_number.substr(6);
}

}  // namespace phone_number
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, the instructions say to clean up the number to just the digits, which matches the number() function. The string operator can format it differently if needed, but the main task is to produce the 10-digit number.

Wait, the example shows all inputs producing '6139950253', which is just the digits, so number() should return that. The area_code() and string operator may be additional requirements from the tests.

This implementation should handle:
1. Removing non-digit characters
2. Validating and removing the country code if present
3. Validating the number of digits
4. Validating area code and exchange code start with digits 2-9

However, the instructions don't mention implementing a class, but since the tests may expect certain member functions, we need to be careful. If the tests expect a different interface, we may need to adjust.

Since the original files were empty, and we're adding a class-based implementation, this should be fine. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle the requirements properly. Let's analyze:

1. The function signatures in the header must match the implementation
2. We need to clean up phone numbers according to the NANP format
3. We need to handle validation and throw appropriate exceptions
4. The number() function should return the cleaned 10-digit number

However, the implementation seems to be correct, but let's make sure it follows the instructions precisely:
1. Remove all non-digit characters
2. If the number has 11 digits and starts with '1', remove the '1'
3. The resulting number must be exactly 10 digits
4. The area code (first 3 digits) must start with 2-9
5. The exchange code (next 3 digits) must start with 2-9

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but perhaps there are issues with the error messages or validation. Let's test our implementation against the requirements.

Actually, the implementation looks correct, but let's make sure:
1. All non-digit characters are removed
2. The country code is only '1' if present
3. The number is exactly 10 digits after processing
4. Area code and exchange code start with digits 2-9

Wait, the implementation seems to do all that. Maybe the issue is with the error messages? The instructions don't specify exact error messages, but the tests might expect specific ones.

Since the user says there are errors, but doesn't specify what they are, I need to be careful. Let's make sure our implementation is robust.

Wait, the implementation uses char comparisons which should work, but to be precise, we can compare to '0' and '1' directly:
digits[0] == '0' || digits[0] == '1' is more explicit

Let's fix that:

Here are the necessary changes:

phone_number.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
phone_number::phone_number(const std::string& raw_number) {
    // First, extract all digits
    std::string digits;
    for (char c : raw_number) {
        if (std::isdigit(c)) {
            digits.push_back(c);
        }
    }
    
    // Check length
    if (digits.length() == 11) {
        if (digits[0] != '1') {
            throw std::domain_error("Invalid country code");
        }
        // Remove the country code
        digits = digits.substr(1);
    }
    
    // Now check if we have exactly 10 digits
    if (digits.length() != 10) {
        throw std::domain_error("Invalid number of digits");
    }
    
    // Check area code (first digit of first 3 digits)
    if ((digits[0] < '2') || (digits[0] > '9')) {
        throw std::domain_error("Area code cannot start with 0 or 1");
    }
    
    // Check exchange code (first digit of next 3 digits)
    if ((digits[3] < '2') || (digits[3] > '9')) {
        throw std::domain_error("Exchange code cannot start with 0 or 1");
    }
    
    cleaned_number = digits;
}
=======
phone_number::phone_number(const std::string& raw_number) {
    // Extract all digits
    std::string digits;
    for (char c : raw_number) {
        if (std::isdigit(static_cast<unsigned char>(c))) {
            digits.push_back(c);
        }
    }
    
    // Check if the number has a country code
    if (digits.length() == 11) {
        if (digits[0] != '1') {
            throw std::domain_error("Invalid number");
        }
        // Remove the country code
        digits.erase(0, 1);
    }
    
    // Check if we have exactly 10 digits
    if (digits.length() != 10) {
        throw std::domain_error("Invalid number");
    }
    
    // Check area code (NXX) - first digit must be between 2-9
    if (digits[0] == '0' || digits[0] == '1') {
        throw std::domain_error("Invalid number");
    }
    
    // Check exchange code (NXX) - first digit must be between 2-9
    if (digits[3] == '0' || digits[3] == '1') {
        throw std::domain_error("Invalid number");
    }
    
    cleaned_number = digits;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation uses more precise checks:
1. Cast to unsigned char for isdigit to avoid potential issues
2. Uses '0' and '1' comparisons which are more explicit
3. Uses erase to remove the country code
4. Uses consistent error messages which may be what the tests expect

However, the error messages are now all "Invalid number" which may match what the tests expect. If not, we can adjust further.

Let's also make sure the number() function returns the cleaned number, which it does:
```cpp
std::string phone_number::number() const {
    return cleaned_number;
}
```

And the area_code() returns the first 3 digits:
```cpp
std::string phone_number::area_code() const {
    return cleaned_number.substr(0, 3);
}
```

And the string operator formats it correctly:
```cpp
phone_number::operator std::string() const {
    // Format as (NXX) NXX-XXXX
    return "(" + area_code() + ") " + cleaned_number.substr(3, 3) + "-" + cleaned_number.substr(6);
}
```

This implementation should now correctly handle:
1. Removing non-digit characters
2. Validating and removing the country code
3. Validating the number of digits
4. Validating area code and exchange code start with valid digits
5. Providing the required interface

If there are still issues, we may need to see specific error messages or test cases to debug further.
