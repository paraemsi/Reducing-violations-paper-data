#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

I understand. We need to create a class that can calculate someone's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the age is given in seconds, and each planet's year is relative to Earth years, we can first calculate the age in Earth years and then divide by the orbital period ratio for each planet.

First, we need to define a class in the header file that can handle these calculations. Let's add a class to the namespace.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a class `space_age` that stores the age in seconds
2. Add methods to get the age on each planet
3. The age on each planet is (age in Earth seconds) / (Earth seconds per year) / (orbital period ratio)

Wait, but the orbital period is given in Earth years, so to get the age on another planet, it's (age in Earth years) / (orbital period)

Since one Earth year is 31557600 seconds, age in Earth years is seconds / 31557600.0
Then, for other planets, it's (seconds / 31557600.0) / orbital_period_ratio

Wait, that's not right. The orbital period is in Earth years, which means:
Mercury's year is 0.2408467 Earth years, so to find age in Mercury years, it's age in Earth years / 0.2408467

Let's implement this:

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    long long age_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(long long seconds);
    long long seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation in space_age.cpp, we need to define all these methods:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_seconds / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return on_earth() / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return on_earth() / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return on_earth() / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should work by first calculating the age in Earth years, and then dividing by each planet's orbital period to get the age in that planet's years. Let's test the provided example:
1,000,000,000 seconds old would be:
on_earth() = 1000000000 / 31557600.0 ≈ 31.69 which matches
on_mercury() = 31.69 / 0.2408467 ≈ 131.57

This seems correct. The implementation is straightforward and efficient.

I understand. The implementation needs to be precise to avoid floating point errors. Let's make sure all calculations are accurate. Since the tests might expect specific precision, we need to be careful.

However, the implementation looks correct. Let's see if there are any issues:
1. The `on_earth()` method is used by other methods, but it's not declared in the header
2. The header declares `on_mercury()` before `on_earth()`, which might be important
3. The implementation needs to match the declaration order

Wait, the header shows:
    long long seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    ...

But in the implementation, `on_earth()` is defined before the others, which is fine, but the order in the header must match the implementation.

Actually, the implementation can be in any order, but the declarations in the header must be in the order shown. The implementation seems to be correct.

But the error markers are on lines 11 and 12, which are:
    long long seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;

Perhaps there's an issue with the implementation of these methods? Let's check:
1. `seconds()` returns the stored age_seconds, which is correct
2. `on_mercury()` uses `on_earth()`, which is correct

Wait, the implementation of `on_earth()` is correct, but it's not declared in the header. But the tests might be calling `on_earth()`, so it needs to be declared in the header.

Wait, the header shows `on_earth()` is declared on line 14, which is after `on_mercury()` and `on_venus()`. So it's there.

Perhaps the issue is with precision? Let's make sure we're using enough precision in our calculations.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the tests expect the age to be calculated directly without using `on_earth()`? Or perhaps there are precision issues.

Let's implement each calculation directly to ensure maximum precision:

Wait, but using `on_earth()` is more maintainable. Let's see:

Wait, the problem might be that `on_mercury()` is called before `on_earth()` is defined in the implementation? No, that's not an issue in C++.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the tests expect the values to be precise to a certain number of decimal places.

Let's precompute the divisors to avoid division operations:
age on planet = seconds / (31557600 * orbital_period)

This might be more precise:
Let's implement each method directly:

Wait, but the implementation is correct. Perhaps there's a typo in the orbital periods?

Wait, the table says:
Mercury: 0.2408467
But in the code, it's used correctly.

Let's make sure all numbers are exactly as provided:
0.2408467
0.61519726
1.0
1.8808158
11.862615
29.447498
84.016846
164.79132

Wait, Earth's orbital period is 1.0, which matches.
But in the implementation, `on_earth()` doesn't divide by 1.0, which is correct.

Perhaps the tests expect `on_earth()` to be defined before other methods in the header? But the order in the header shows `on_earth()` after `on_mercury()` and `on_venus()`.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Maybe the issue is that `on_earth()` is not declared in the header before `on_mercury()` is used? But that's not necessary.

Actually, the implementation is correct. Perhaps the error is elsewhere.

Wait, the implementation needs to be in the exact order as declared in the header. Let's reorder the implementation to match the header:

Wait, but the order of implementation doesn't matter in C++.

Perhaps there's a precision issue. Let's use more precise calculations by doing:
age_seconds / (31557600.0 * orbital_period)

This might be better:
Let's change the implementation to:

Wait, but the current implementation is:
on_earth() / orbital_period
Which is the same as:
(age_seconds / 31557600.0) / orbital_period = age_seconds / (31557600.0 * orbital_period)

So it's the same.

Let's implement each method directly to see if that fixes any issues:

Here's the revised implementation:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_seconds / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return on_earth() / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return on_earth() / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return on_earth() / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_seconds / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 0.2408467);
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 0.61519726);
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 1.8808158);
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 11.862615);
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 29.447498);
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 84.016846);
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 164.79132);
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation does the calculation directly, which might help with precision. Let's hope this fixes any issues.
