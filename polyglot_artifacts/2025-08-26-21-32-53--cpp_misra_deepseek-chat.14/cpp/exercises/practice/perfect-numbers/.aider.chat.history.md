#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of [perfect](#perfect), [abundant](#abundant), or [deficient](#deficient) based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The _aliquot sum_ is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of `15` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.  
####   
#### ## Perfect  
####   
#### A number is perfect when it equals its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `6` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`  
#### - `28` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`  
####   
#### ## Abundant  
####   
#### A number is abundant when it is less than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `12` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
#### - `24` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36`  
####   
#### ## Deficient  
####   
#### A number is deficient when it is greater than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `8` is a deficient number because `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`  
#### - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is [perfect](#perfect).  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is [abundant](#abundant) or [deficient](#deficient).

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: perfect_numbers.cpp perfect_numbers.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a classification for numbers based on their aliquot sum. Let's think through this:

1. We need to calculate the aliquot sum of a number
2. Compare it to the number itself to classify it
3. Since the classification can be one of three types, we'll need an enum or similar

Since the instructions mention that we may need to determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient, we'll need a function that can return this classification.

However, the files provided are empty namespaces, so we need to add the necessary implementation.

Let's start by defining an enumeration type in the header to represent the classification, and then implement a function to determine the classification.

Here are the necessary changes:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int64_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the classify function in perfect_numbers.cpp:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case (its only factor is 1, which is itself, so aliquot sum is 0)
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to include <stdexcept> for std::domain_error
2. We need to handle edge cases:
   - Numbers <= 0 should throw an exception
   - The number 1 is a special case (its aliquot sum is 0, which is less than 1, so it's deficient)
3. We need to efficiently find all proper divisors to compute the aliquot sum
4. We're using std::int64_t to handle potentially large numbers

This implementation uses a mathematical optimization to find divisors up to the square root of the number, which is efficient. For each divisor found, we add both the divisor and its complement (if they're different).

Wait, the aliquot sum is the sum of proper divisors, which are divisors less than the number itself. So when number is a perfect square, we need to be careful not to include the number itself if it's a divisor. But since we're only going up to the square root, and number is always greater than i, other_divisor will always be less than number when i > 1. When i == 1, we've already added it at the start.

This implementation should work correctly:
- For number = 6: divisors are 1, 2, 3 → sum = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 → perfect
- For number = 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 → sum = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28 → perfect
- For number = 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 → abundant
- For number = 8: 1, 2, 4 → sum = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 → deficient
- For prime numbers: only 1 is a proper divisor → sum = 1 < number → deficient

This matches all the examples provided. Let's proceed with this implementation.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle the requirements. Let's fix the issues:

1. The implementation needs to be efficient and correct
2. We need to ensure all proper divisors are summed, excluding the number itself
3. We need to handle edge cases properly

Wait, the implementation in perfect_numbers.cpp may not be correct. For example, when number is a perfect square, we might be adding the square root twice, but that's not the case because we check if other_divisor != i
But there's another issue: the loop condition may not find all divisors correctly

Wait, the implementation seems to work, but let's test it with number=4:
Proper divisors: 1, 2 → sum=3
i goes up to 2 (sqrt(4)=2)
i=2: 4%2==0 → add 2, other_divisor=2 → since other_divisor == i, don't add again
sum=1+2=3 → which matches

This seems correct.

Wait, but the number itself should not be included in the aliquot sum, which it isn't because i always <= sqrt(number) < number for number > 1

However, there's a potential integer overflow when casting std::sqrt(number) to std::int64_t
Let's fix that by using a floating point number for the comparison

Wait, but to avoid floating point inaccuracies, it's better to use integer math
Let's use i*i <= number

Here's the revised implementation:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case (its only factor is 1, which is itself, so aliquot sum is 0)
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case - its only proper divisor is none, sum is 0 which is less than 1
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor for numbers > 1
    // Find all divisors up to the square root
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i * i <= number; ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t complement = number / i;
            if (complement != i) {
                sum += complement;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Compare the sum to the number to determine the classification
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation uses integer math to avoid potential floating point inaccuracies and is more efficient. Let's test it with some cases:

1. number = 6: i goes up to 2 (2*2=4 <=6)
   i=2: 6%2==0 → sum +=2, complement=3 → sum +=3 → sum=1+2+3=6 → perfect
2. number = 28: i goes up to 5 (5*5=25 <=28)
   i=2: sum +=2, complement=14 → sum +=14 → sum=1+2+14=17
   i=4: 28%4==0 → sum +=4, complement=7 → sum +=7 → sum=17+4+7=28 → perfect
3. number = 12: i goes up to 3 (3*3=9 <=12)
   i=2: sum +=2, complement=6 → sum +=6 → sum=1+2+6=9
   i=3: 12%3==0 → sum +=3, complement=4 → sum +=4 → sum=9+3+4=16 → abundant
4. number = 8: i goes up to 2 (2*2=4 <=8)
   i=2: 8%2==0 → sum +=2, complement=4 → sum +=4 → sum=1+2+4=7 → deficient

This matches all the provided examples. This implementation should now be correct.
