#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: space_age.cpp space_age.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a class that can calculate someone's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the age is given in seconds, and we know that one Earth year is 31,557,600 seconds, we can first calculate the age in Earth years, and then divide by the orbital period of each planet to get the age on that planet.

However, to be precise, we should use floating point numbers to handle the fractional years accurately.

Let's implement a class in the space_age namespace that can handle this. Since the problem mentions not to change existing function names, and the files are empty, we need to define a class or functions that can do this.

Wait, the instructions say "Don't change the names of existing functions or classes", but the files are empty. So we need to define what's expected.

Typically, for such problems, we might need to implement a class that can be constructed with the age in seconds, and then have member functions to get the age on each planet.

Let's implement a class `space_age` with a constructor that takes the age in seconds, and member functions for each planet:
- mercury(), venus(), earth(), etc.

Here's the plan:
1. In space_age.h, declare the class with private member to store age in seconds
2. In space_age.cpp, implement the class methods

Since we need to use fixed-width types, we'll use appropriate types from <cstdint>

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    std::int64_t age_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(std::int64_t seconds);
    std::int64_t seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for space_age.cpp, we need to implement these methods:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"
#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(std::int64_t seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

std::int64_t space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    constexpr double earth_year_seconds = 31557600.0;
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_year_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return on_earth() / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return on_earth() / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return on_earth() / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all floating point operations are precise and follow the requirements. Since the orbital periods are given with high precision, using double is appropriate.

This implementation should work by first calculating the age in Earth years, and then dividing by each planet's orbital period to get the age on that planet. The `seconds()` method just returns the original age in seconds, which seems to be required.

Note: The implementation uses `explicit` for the constructor to prevent implicit conversions, which is good practice.
Also, all member functions are marked `const` since they don't modify the object's state.

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
1. Calculate age on each planet based on the given age in seconds
2. Use appropriate types
3. Follow the provided orbital periods
4. Be precise with floating point calculations

Let me know if you have any questions or if there are any issues with this implementation.

I understand. The issue is that we're using `std::int64_t` which violates the MISRA C++ rules provided. We need to use fixed-width types from `<cstdint>`, but the rule says we shouldn't use the standard signed integer types directly. Instead, we should create aliases for them.

However, the rule says to include `<cstdint>` and use fixed-width types, which seems to contradict itself. Let's interpret it as: always use the fixed-width types from `<cstdint>` (like `int64_t`) and not the basic types (like `int`, `long`, etc.).

Wait, the rule says:
"The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used"
But `int64_t` is a fixed-width type, not a standard type like `int`, `long`, etc.

Actually, the rule says to use fixed-width types from `<cstdint>`, which is what we're doing. So perhaps there's another issue.

Wait, the rule says:
"Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long"
But we're using `std::int64_t` which is from `<cstdint>`, which should be fine.

Perhaps the issue is that we need to be consistent with the types. Let's make sure all integer types are from `<cstdint>` and use fixed-width types.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the error markers are just pointing out that we need to ensure we're following all the rules, including parentheses in expressions.

Let's check if all expressions have proper parentheses:
1. All binary operations need to be properly parenthesized
2. We need to ensure no mixing of types

Wait, in the implementation, we have divisions which are binary operations. Let's make sure they're properly parenthesized.

Actually, all the divisions are simple and don't need extra parentheses because they're at the same precedence level. But to be safe, let's add parentheses.

Wait, the rule says:
"Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression."
Since we're just doing division, and both operands are at the same precedence level, it's fine.

But to be extra careful, let's add parentheses around the divisions.

Wait, the rule also says:
"Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate"
We're assigning the result of a division (which is double) to a double return type, which is fine.

Let's make sure all our floating point constants are of the right type to prevent any implicit conversions.

Here are the necessary fixes:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"
#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(std::int64_t seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    constexpr double earth_year_seconds = 31557600.0;
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_year_seconds;
}

    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"

space_age::space_age(std::int64_t seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

std::int64_t space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    constexpr double earth_year_seconds = 31557600.0;
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds)) / earth_year_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return (on_earth()) / (0.2408467);
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return (on_earth()) / (0.61519726);
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return (on_earth()) / (1.8808158);
}

}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {

}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return (on_earth()) / (84.016846);
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return (on_earth()) / (164.79132);
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This adds parentheses around each division operation to ensure precedence is clear, though it's not strictly necessary since division is left-associative and both operands are at the same precedence level. But to follow the rules strictly, we'll include them.

Also, the header file seems fine. The use of `std::int64_t` is appropriate as it's a fixed-width type from `<cstdint>`, which follows the rules:
1. We included `<cstdint>`
2. We're using fixed-width types
3. We're not using standard integer types like int, long, etc.

This implementation should now comply with the provided MISRA C++ rules. Let me know if there are any other issues.
