#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a fancy store.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value and weight.  
#### Bob would gladly take all of the items, but his knapsack can only hold so much weight.  
#### Bob has to carefully consider which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to determine which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized, taking into account the knapsack's carrying capacity.  
####   
#### Items will be represented as a list of items.  
#### Each item will have a weight and value.  
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10  
#### ```  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.h knapsack.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a solution to the classic 0/1 knapsack problem. Since Bob can take each item at most once, and we need to maximize the total value without exceeding the maximum weight, we can use dynamic programming.

However, the implementation needs to be efficient, especially considering the constraints. Since the maximum weight can be up to 1000 or more, and the number of items can be up to 100 or more, we need a dynamic programming approach that's O(n*W) where n is the number of items and W is the maximum weight.

Let's implement this by adding a function to the knapsack namespace that takes a list of items and the maximum weight, and returns the maximum value.

First, let's update the header file to declare the function:

knapsack.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    int weight;
    int value;
};

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
=======
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    std::int32_t weight;
    std::int32_t value;
};

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items);

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the function in the cpp file. We'll use dynamic programming where dp[i][w] represents the maximum value that can be obtained using the first i items with a maximum weight of w.

However, to optimize space, we can use a 1D array and update it from right to left.

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"

namespace knapsack
{

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty()) 
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores the maximum value for weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items) 
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, we process from the end
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w) 
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value)) 
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    return *std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. All values are strictly positive, which is good
2. We need to ensure we're using the correct types
3. The implementation needs to be efficient

This implementation uses a 1D DP array which is more space efficient. We process each item and for each possible weight from maximum_weight down to the item's weight, we update the maximum value we can get by either including or excluding the current item.

Since we're processing from the end, we ensure that we don't use the same item more than once, which satisfies the condition that Bob can take only one of each item.

This implementation should work within the constraints:
- Time complexity: O(n * maximum_weight)
- Space complexity: O(maximum_weight)

However, if maximum_weight is very large (like 1,000,000) and there are many items, it might be too slow, but the problem statement doesn't specify constraints, so we'll assume this is fine.

Let's test the provided example:
Items: [
  { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },
  { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }
]
Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10

Processing:
1. For item 1 (5, 10): Update weights 10 down to 5
2. For item 2 (4, 40): Update weights 10 down to 4
3. etc.

The maximum value should be 90, which matches the example.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle cases where the maximum weight is 0, and to ensure that all operations are valid. Let's fix the implementation:

1. The weight and value should be non-negative, which they are according to the instructions
2. We need to make sure we don't access negative indices
3. We need to always find the maximum value up to maximum_weight

Wait, the maximum value might not always be at the end of the dp array, but since we're filling it properly, the maximum value will be the maximum of all entries up to maximum_weight
But to be precise, we can just take dp[maximum_weight] if we always update correctly

Actually, in the standard implementation, dp[w] represents the maximum value that can be achieved with weight exactly w, but sometimes it's better to track the maximum value up to weight w
To always have dp[w] be the maximum value with weight at most w, we need to make sure to propagate maximum values

Wait, but our implementation may not always fill every index, so we need to make sure that for weights that can't be achieved, they don't contribute to the maximum
But since we initialize with 0, it's fine

However, to always have the maximum value up to weight w, we can track the maximum as we go
But it's easier to just find the maximum in the dp array at the end

Wait, but the implementation needs to be efficient
Let's fix the implementation to always track the maximum value correctly

Here are the necessary fixes:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty()) 
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores the maximum value for weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items) 
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, we process from the end
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w) 
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value)) 
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    return *std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"

#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    // Handle case when maximum weight is 0 or no items
    if ((maximum_weight == 0) || (items.empty())) 
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores the maximum value that can be achieved with weight at most w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items) 
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, we process from the end
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= 0; --w) 
        {
            if (item.weight <= w) 
            {
                if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value)) 
                {
                    dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The maximum value will be at dp[maximum_weight]
    // But to be safe, we can find the maximum in the entire array
    // However, since all values are non-negative, and we're always trying to maximize within the weight constraint,
    // dp[maximum_weight] should have the maximum value
    return dp[maximum_weight];
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, this implementation may be less efficient because it always loops down to 0, but it's more correct.
But to optimize, we can break early when w is less than item.weight

Wait, the condition in the for loop can be adjusted to only process relevant weights:
But to make sure we don't access negative indices, we need to start from maximum_weight down to item.weight

Wait, but the implementation above always goes down to 0, which is correct but less efficient
Let's fix that:

Wait, the implementation needs to be efficient, so let's process only where item.weight <= w
But to do that, we can adjust the loop bounds

Actually, the initial implementation was almost correct, but it may not handle cases where maximum_weight is 0
Let's fix that first

Wait, the main issue is to always have valid indices
Let's make sure we always process within bounds

Here's a better approach:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    // Handle case when maximum weight is 0 or no items
    if ((maximum_weight == 0) || (items.empty())) 
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores the maximum value that can be achieved with weight at most w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items) 
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, we process from the end
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= 0; --w) 
        {
            if (item.weight <= w) 
            {
                if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value)) 
                {
                    dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The maximum value will be at dp[maximum_weight]
    // But to be safe, we can find the maximum in the entire array
    // However, since all values are non-negative, and we're always trying to maximize within the weight constraint,
    // dp[maximum_weight] should have the maximum value
    return dp[maximum_weight];
=======
    // Handle case when maximum weight is 0
    if (maximum_weight < 0) 
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores the maximum value that can be achieved with weight at most w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items) 
    {
        // Process from the end to avoid reusing items
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w) 
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value)) 
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Since all values are non-negative, the maximum value will be at dp[maximum_weight]
    // To find the maximum value up to maximum_weight, which is what we want
    return dp[maximum_weight];
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should now be correct and efficient:
1. It handles cases where maximum_weight is 0 by initializing dp[0] to 0
2. It only processes weights where item.weight <= w, which is efficient
3. It always uses valid indices
4. All values are non-negative, so dp[maximum_weight] will have the maximum value

This should now work for the provided example:
Items: weight 4, value 50 and weight 4, value 40 can be taken to get value 90 within weight 8, which is <= 10
But the maximum value at weight 10 will be at least 90, which matches the example

Let's hope this implementation passes all test cases.
