#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Clean up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.  
####   
#### The **North American Numbering Plan (NANP)** is a telephone numbering system used by many countries in North America like the United States, Canada or Bermuda.  
#### All NANP-countries share the same international country code: `1`.  
####   
#### NANP numbers are ten-digit numbers consisting of a three-digit Numbering Plan Area code, commonly known as _area code_, followed by a seven-digit local number.  
#### The first three digits of the local number represent the _exchange code_, followed by the unique four-digit number which is the _subscriber number_.  
####   
#### The format is usually represented as  
####   
#### ```text  
#### NXX NXX-XXXX  
#### ```  
####   
#### where `N` is any digit from 2 through 9 and `X` is any digit from 0 through 9.  
####   
#### Sometimes they also have the country code (represented as `1` or `+1`) prefixed.  
####   
#### Your task is to clean up differently formatted telephone numbers by removing punctuation and the country code if present.  
####   
#### For example, the inputs  
####   
#### - `+1 (613)-995-0253`  
#### - `613-995-0253`  
#### - `1 613 995 0253`  
#### - `613.995.0253`  
####   
#### should all produce the output  
####   
#### `6139950253`  
####   
#### **Note:** As this exercise only deals with telephone numbers used in NANP-countries, only 1 is considered a valid country code.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: phone_number.cpp phone_number.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a function to clean up phone numbers according to the NANP format. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the function needs to be in a namespace, and we need to process the input string to extract a valid NANP number, we'll need to:
1. Remove all non-digit characters
2. Check if the number has a country code '1' prefix, and remove it if present
3. Validate the resulting number to ensure it matches NANP format

However, the function signature isn't specified, so we need to decide what it should be. Since this is C++, and the examples show a class, perhaps we need to implement a class with a constructor that takes a string and validates it.

Wait, the files show an empty namespace, so we need to add a class or function. Let's add a class that stores the cleaned number.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a class `phone_number` in the namespace
2. It should have a constructor that takes a string
3. Clean and validate the number
4. Throw an exception if the number is invalid
5. Provide access to area code, number, etc.

However, the instructions don't specify the exact interface, so we need to be careful. Let's implement a basic class that can store the number and provide area code, exchange code, etc.

Wait, the instructions say to clean up the number, so perhaps we just need a function that returns the cleaned number as a string.
But since it's a class, we need to implement it appropriately.

Let's implement a class that can parse and validate the phone number, and provide methods to access its parts.

Here are the necessary changes:

phone_number.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PHONE_NUMBER_H)
#define PHONE_NUMBER_H

namespace phone_number {

}  // namespace phone_number

#endif // PHONE_NUMBER_H
=======
#if !defined(PHONE_NUMBER_H)
#define PHONE_NUMBER_H

#include <string>

namespace phone_number {

class phone_number {
public:
    explicit phone_number(const std::string& raw_number);
    std::string number() const;
    std::string area_code() const;
    operator std::string() const;
    
private:
    std::string number_;
};

}  // namespace phone_number

#endif // PHONE_NUMBER_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in phone_number.cpp:

phone_number.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "phone_number.h"

namespace phone_number {

}  // namespace phone_number
=======
#include "phone_number.h"
#include <string>
#include <cctype>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace phone_number {

phone_number::phone_number(const std::string& raw_number) {
    // First, extract all digits
    std::string digits;
    for (char c : raw_number) {
        if (std::isdigit(c)) {
            digits.push_back(c);
        }
    }
    
    // Check if the number has a country code
    if ((digits.length() == 11) && (digits[0] == '1')) {
        digits = digits.substr(1);
    }
    
    // Validate the number
    if (digits.length() != 10) {
        throw std::domain_error("Invalid number of digits");
    }
    
    // Check area code and exchange code first digits
    if ((digits[0] < '2') || (digits[0] > '9')) {
        throw std::domain_error("Area code cannot start with zero or one");
    }
    if ((digits[3] < '2') || (digits[3] > '9')) {
        throw std::domain_error("Exchange code cannot start with zero or one");
    }
    
    number_ = digits;
}

std::string phone_number::number() const {
    return number_;
}

std::string phone_number::area_code() const {
    return number_.substr(0, 3);
}

phone_number::operator std::string() const {
    // Format as NXX NXX-XXXX
    return "(" + area_code() + ") " + number_.substr(3, 3) + "-" + number_.substr(6);
}

}  // namespace phone_number
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, the instructions say to just produce the output `6139950253`, which matches the number() method. The string operator can format it differently if needed, but the main requirement is to clean up the number to just digits.

Wait, the instructions don't mention throwing exceptions, but it's the most appropriate way to handle invalid numbers in C++. If the tests expect something else, we may need to adjust.

This implementation should:
1. Remove all non-digit characters
2. Handle the country code '1' prefix by removing it
3. Validate the number length and the first digits of area and exchange codes
4. Provide access to the cleaned number

However, the instructions don't specify what to do with invalid numbers, so throwing an exception seems appropriate. If the tests expect something else, we'll need to adjust.

Note: The operator std::string() allows the object to be treated as a string, which might be useful for output. But the main requirement is to clean up the number, which is handled by number().

Let's proceed with this implementation.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle the requirements correctly. Let's analyze:

1. The number should be cleaned to just digits
2. If there's a country code '1', it should be removed
3. The number must be exactly 10 digits after cleaning
4. The area code (first 3 digits) and exchange code (4th digit) must be valid (N=2-9)
5. All other characters should be ignored

However, the implementation needs to be precise. Let's fix any issues:

Here are the necessary fixes:

phone_number.cpp
```cpp

            digits.push_back(c);
        }
    }
    
    // Check if the number has a country code
    if ((digits.length() == 11) && (digits[0] == '1')) {
        digits = digits.substr(1);
    }

}

phone_number::operator std::string() const {
    // Format as NXX NXX-XXXX

}

}  // namespace phone_number
=======
#include "phone_number.h"
#include <string>
#include <cctype>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace phone_number {

phone_number::phone_number(const std::string& raw_number) {
    // Extract all digits
    std::string digits;
    for (char c : raw_number) {
        if (std::isdigit(static_cast<unsigned char>(c))) {
            digits.push_back(c);
        }
    }
    
    // Check length
    if (digits.length() == 11) {
        // Check if the first digit is the country code '1'
        if (digits[0] == '1') {
            // Remove the country code
            digits = digits.substr(1);
        } else {
            throw std::domain_error("Invalid number of digits or country code");
        }
    }
    
    // After processing, the number must be exactly 10 digits
    if (digits.length() != 10) {
        throw std::domain_error("Invalid number of digits");
    }
    
    // Check area code (first digit must be between '2' and '9')

    return "(" + area_code() + ") " + number_.substr(3, 3) + "-" + number_.substr(6);

```

This implementation should now handle:
1. Valid numbers with and without the country code '1'
2. Numbers with various punctuation
3. Validation of area code and exchange code
4. Proper error handling for invalid numbers

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to cast to unsigned char for std::isdigit to avoid undefined behavior
2. If the number has 11 digits but the first digit is not '1', it's invalid
3. All other cases where the number doesn't have exactly 10 digits after processing are invalid
4. The area code and exchange code must start with digits between 2-9

This implementation should now be correct. Let's test it with the provided examples:
- `+1 (613)-995-0253` → '1' prefix is removed, then validate '6139950253'
- `613-995-0253` → '6139950253' directly
- `1 613 995 0253` → '1' prefix is removed, then validate '6139950253'
- `613.995.0253` → '6139950253' directly

All these should produce '6139950253' which is stored in number_ and returned by number().

The operator std::string() formats it in a user-friendly way, which may be useful for display purposes.
