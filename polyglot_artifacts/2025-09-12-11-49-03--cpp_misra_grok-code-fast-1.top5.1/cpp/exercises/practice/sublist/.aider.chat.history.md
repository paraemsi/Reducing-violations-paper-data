#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given any two lists `A` and `B`, determine if:  
####   
#### - List `A` is equal to list `B`; or  
#### - List `A` contains list `B` (`A` is a superlist of `B`); or  
#### - List `A` is contained by list `B` (`A` is a sublist of `B`); or  
#### - None of the above is true, thus lists `A` and `B` are unequal  
####   
#### Specifically, list `A` is equal to list `B` if both lists have the same values in the same order.  
#### List `A` is a superlist of `B` if `A` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `B`.  
#### List `A` is a sublist of `B` if `B` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `A`.  
####   
#### Examples:  
####   
#### - If `A = []` and `B = []` (both lists are empty), then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = []`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = []` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4, 5]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `B = [2, 3, 4]`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 3, 2]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
####

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: sublist.h sublist.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not use the keywords signed/unsigned char, short, int, long, or long long (and their unsigned forms) for variables, parameters, or return types.    
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types such as std::int8_t, std::uint16_t, std::int32_t, std::uint64_t, or project-specific typedefs/aliases that wrap them.    
#### - int is permitted only for the main() return type, its parameters (argc, argv), and as the dummy int in postfix ++/-- operators; avoid it elsewhere.    
#### - Typedef/using declarations that create aliases are allowed and encouraged for readability.    
#### - Plain char is covered by another rule; avoid it for integers.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Parenthesize every sub-expression that combines binary or ternary operators with different precedence levels ( *, /, %, +, -, <<, >>, <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, &, ^, |, &&, ||, ?: ).    
#### - Omit parentheses only when adjacent operators share the exact same precedence and associativity (e.g. `a + b - c`, `x & y ^ z`).    
#### - Unary operators may remain unparenthesized when used inside a larger expression (`a * -b` is OK).    
#### - Never rely on default precedence in conditions, assignments, returns, or initializers; make evaluation order explicit: `if ((a == 1) && (b > 0))`, `val = a * (b + 1);`.    
#### - Treat overloaded operators with the same caution; add parentheses for clarity even if the rule does not mandate it.    
#### - Example pitfalls: avoid `a * b + 1`, `if (a + b != c - d)`, `if (x == 0 && y > 1)`; rewrite with parentheses.  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Never convert character types (‘char’, ‘signed/unsigned char’, ‘wchar_t’, ‘char16_t’, ‘char32_t’) to or from any non-character arithmetic type (int, bool, enum, float, …); forbid both implicit assignments and casts.    
#### - Do not perform arithmetic, bitwise, relational (<, >, <=, >=), or ++/-- on character objects; only == and != between identical character types are allowed.    
#### - Initialise/assign character variables exclusively with character literals of the same category (e.g., char c = '\n'; wchar_t w = L'x';), not numeric constants.    
#### - When an integer representation is unavoidable, use library helpers such as std::char_traits<CharT>::to_int_type(), never rely on direct conversion.    
#### - Use <cctype>/<cwctype> utilities (std::isalpha, std::tolower, …) instead of numeric range checks on characters.    
#### - Raw byte or small-integer data should be held in std::byte, std::uint8_t, or int8_t, not in char-family types.    
#### - Unevaluated operands (sizeof, decltype, alignof) and casts to void of a function call returning a character are permissible.  
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep numeric assignments strictly safe: identical type category, signedness and size, or an allowed widening/constant case    
#### - OK: same category & signedness, destination wider, source is a single variable (id-expression) ‒ e.g. `uint32_t big = small8;`    
#### - OK: floating-point constant → wider floating type ‒ e.g. `long double ld = 1.0f;`    
#### - OK: integer constant/constant expression → any numeric type (or bit-field) whose range can hold the value ‒ e.g. `float f = 42;`, `uint8_t u = 255;`    
#### - Otherwise: do NOT assign, initialise, pass by value, return, or use in a `case` label    
####   • No wider→narrower size (e.g. `uint8_t u = uint32_t_val;`)    
####   • No signed↔unsigned change (e.g. `uint32_t = int32_t;`)    
####   • No integer↔floating conversion except the constant cases above    
####   • No value that exceeds target range    
#### - For widening, use a variable, not an arithmetic expression; if you must convert, use an explicit cast that yields a compliant source type first    
#### - Apply the same checks in constructors, default arguments, lambda captures, operator calls, etc. ‒ every by-value transfer counts as an assignment    
#### - Treat unscoped enums as their underlying integral type when checking these rules  
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always wrap the body of every `if` in `{ … }`, even if it is a single statement    
#### - Always wrap the body of every `else` in `{ … }`; braces may be omitted only when the `else` is immediately followed by another `if` (`else if`)    
#### - Do not place any non-braced statement directly after `if (…)` or `else`    
#### - Never write `if (condition);` — replace with a braced empty block or remove the statement    
#### - Keep braces and indentation consistent so the controlled block is visually unambiguous  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

Based on the instructions, I need to implement functionality to determine the relationship between two lists (A and B) as described: equal, sublist, superlist, or unequal. The current files (sublist.h and sublist.cpp) are essentially empty, so changes are required to add the necessary declarations and implementations.

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Overall Structure**:
   - I'll define an enum `classification` in `sublist.h` to represent the possible outcomes: `equal`, `sublist`, `superlist`, or `unequal`.
   - I'll declare a function `classify` that takes two `std::vector<std::int32_t>` (representing the lists) and returns the `classification`.
   - In `sublist.cpp`, I'll implement the logic for `classify`:
     - Check if A and B are equal (using `==`).
     - Check if A is a sublist of B (i.e., A is a subsequence of B) using `std::search`.
     - Check if A is a superlist of B (i.e., B is a subsequence of A).
     - Otherwise, they are unequal.
   - Handle empty lists as per the examples (e.g., two empty lists are equal; an empty list is a sublist of any non-empty list).
   - Use `std::vector<std::int32_t>` for the lists, as it aligns with the examples (integer values) and follows MISRA rules (fixed-width types from `<cstdint>`).

2. **MISRA C++ Compliance**:
   - Used fixed-width types (`std::int32_t`) instead of `int`.
   - Added parentheses around expressions with mixed precedence (e.g., in conditions and assignments).
   - Ensured all `if` and `else` bodies are compound statements (wrapped in `{}`).
   - No direct arithmetic or conversions on characters (not applicable here).
   - Assignments are safe (e.g., no narrowing conversions; using constants or same types).
   - Included only standard libraries (`<cstdint>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>` for `std::search`).

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - The `classify` function uses `std::search` to check for subsequences, which is efficient and standard.
   - Edge cases: Empty lists are handled correctly (e.g., `[]` is a sublist of any list, and equal to another `[]`).
   - No changes to existing function/class names (none exist yet).
   - The code is self-contained and uses only standard libraries.

Here are the updated files:

sublist.h
```
#pragma once

#include <cstdint>
#include <vector>

namespace sublist {

enum class classification {
    equal,
    sublist,
    superlist,
    unequal
};

classification classify(const std::vector<std::int32_t>& a, const std::vector<std::int32_t>& b);

}  // namespace sublist
```

sublist.cpp
```
#include "sublist.h"

#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

namespace sublist {

classification classify(const std::vector<std::int32_t>& a, const std::vector<std::int32_t>& b) {
    if ((a == b)) {
        return classification::equal;
    }
    if ((a.empty()) || (std::search(b.begin(), b.end(), a.begin(), a.end()) != b.end())) {
        return classification::sublist;
    }
    if ((b.empty()) || (std::search(a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), b.end()) != a.end())) {
        return classification::superlist;
    }
    return classification::unequal;
}

}  // namespace sublist

The request to "fix any errors below" is ambiguous because no specific errors are described in the provided file contents or the marked lines (13, 15, and 17 in sublist.h). The code appears syntactically correct and compliant with the previous MISRA C++ rules and instructions. If there are particular errors (e.g., compilation issues, logical bugs, or MISRA violations) you have in mind, please provide more details so I can address them accurately. Otherwise, no changes are needed.

The request to "fix any errors below" is ambiguous because no specific errors are described in the provided file contents or the marked lines (13, 15, and 17 in sublist.h). The code appears syntactically correct and compliant with the previous MISRA C++ rules and instructions. If there are particular errors (e.g., compilation issues, logical bugs, or MISRA violations) you have in mind, please provide more details so I can address them accurately. Otherwise, no changes are needed.
