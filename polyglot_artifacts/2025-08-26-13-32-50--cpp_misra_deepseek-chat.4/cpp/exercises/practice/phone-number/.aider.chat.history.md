#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Clean up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.  
####   
#### The **North American Numbering Plan (NANP)** is a telephone numbering system used by many countries in North America like the United States, Canada or Bermuda.  
#### All NANP-countries share the same international country code: `1`.  
####   
#### NANP numbers are ten-digit numbers consisting of a three-digit Numbering Plan Area code, commonly known as _area code_, followed by a seven-digit local number.  
#### The first three digits of the local number represent the _exchange code_, followed by the unique four-digit number which is the _subscriber number_.  
####   
#### The format is usually represented as  
####   
#### ```text  
#### NXX NXX-XXXX  
#### ```  
####   
#### where `N` is any digit from 2 through 9 and `X` is any digit from 0 through 9.  
####   
#### Sometimes they also have the country code (represented as `1` or `+1`) prefixed.  
####   
#### Your task is to clean up differently formatted telephone numbers by removing punctuation and the country code if present.  
####   
#### For example, the inputs  
####   
#### - `+1 (613)-995-0253`  
#### - `613-995-0253`  
#### - `1 613 995 0253`  
#### - `613.995.0253`  
####   
#### should all produce the output  
####   
#### `6139950253`  
####   
#### **Note:** As this exercise only deals with telephone numbers used in NANP-countries, only 1 is considered a valid country code.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: phone_number.h phone_number.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a function to clean up phone numbers according to the NANP rules. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the function isn't specified, I'll assume we need to implement a class or function that can parse and validate phone numbers. Let's create a `phone_number` class that takes a raw number string and provides a cleaned number.

However, the instructions mention not to change existing functions or classes, but the provided files are empty. So we need to implement everything from scratch.

Let's implement a class that can:
1. Remove all non-digit characters
2. Check if the number has a country code and remove it if valid
3. Validate the number according to NANP rules
4. Provide the area code, exchange code, and subscriber number

Since the implementation needs to be in C++, we'll need to include necessary headers and follow the given rules.

Here's the plan:
1. Remove all non-digit characters from the input
2. Check the length:
   If it's 11 digits, the first must be '1' (country code)
   If it's 10 digits, it's valid
   Otherwise, it's invalid
3. Validate N, X positions according to the rules

Let's implement:

Here are the necessary changes:

phone_number.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PHONE_NUMBER_H)
#define PHONE_NUMBER_H

namespace phone_number {

}  // namespace phone_number

#endif // PHONE_NUMBER_H
=======
#if !defined(PHONE_NUMBER_H)
#define PHONE_NUMBER_H

#include <string>

namespace phone_number {

class phone_number {
public:
    explicit phone_number(const std::string& raw_number);
    std::string number() const;
    std::string area_code() const;
    operator std::string() const;
    
private:
    std::string cleaned_number;
};

}  // namespace phone_number

#endif // PHONE_NUMBER_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in phone_number.cpp:

phone_number.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "phone_number.h"

namespace phone_number {

}  // namespace phone_number
=======
#include "phone_number.h"
#include <string>
#include <cctype>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace phone_number {

phone_number::phone_number(const std::string& raw_number) {
    // First, extract all digits
    for (char c : raw_number) {
        if (std::isdigit(c)) {
            cleaned_number += c;
        }
    }
    
    // Check the length
    if (cleaned_number.length() == 11) {
        if (cleaned_number[0] != '1') {
            throw std::domain_error("Invalid country code");
        }
        // Remove the country code
        cleaned_number = cleaned_number.substr(1);
    }
    
    // Now check if the number is exactly 10 digits
    if (cleaned_number.length() != 10) {
        throw std::domain_error("Invalid number of digits");
    }
    
    // Check area code (first digit N must be 2-9)
    if ((cleaned_number[0] < '2') || (cleaned_number[0] > '9')) {
        throw std::domain_error("Area code cannot start with zero or one");
    }
    
    // Check exchange code (fourth digit N must be 2-9)
    if ((cleaned_number[3] < '2') || (cleaned_number[3] > '9')) {
        throw std::domain_error("Exchange code cannot start with zero or one");
    }
}

std::string phone_number::number() const {
    return cleaned_number;
}

std::string phone_number::area_code() const {
    return cleaned_number.substr(0, 3);
}

phone_number::operator std::string() const {
    return "(" + area_code() + ") " + cleaned_number.substr(3, 3) + "-" + cleaned_number.substr(6);
}

}  // namespace phone_number
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, the instructions say to clean up the number and produce a 10-digit number, which matches what the `number()` method returns. The `operator std::string()` is to format it according to the NANP standard, which may be useful.

Wait, the instructions don't mention formatting, just cleaning up to get '6139950253' from various inputs. So the `number()` method should return exactly that.

This implementation should handle:
1. Removing non-digit characters
2. Validating and removing the country code if present
3. Validating the number of digits
4. Validating area code and exchange code start digits
5. Throwing appropriate exceptions for invalid numbers

However, the instructions don't specify what to do with invalid numbers, but throwing exceptions seems appropriate.

This implementation follows the rules:
1. Uses std::string which is appropriate
2. No integer types are used directly
3. All operations are valid

Let's test this approach:
- +1 (613)-995-0253 → '1' is removed, leaving 6139950253
- 613-995-0253 → digits are extracted to 6139950253
- 1 613 995 0253 → '1' is removed, leaving 6139950253
- 613.995.0253 → digits are extracted to 6139950253

All produce '6139950253' which matches the requirement.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle the requirements correctly. Let's analyze:

1. The number should be cleaned to only digits
2. If there are 11 digits, the first must be '1' which is the country code, and it should be removed
3. The resulting number must be exactly 10 digits
4. The area code (first 3 digits) and exchange code (next 3 digits) must start with digits 2-9
5. All other digits can be 0-9

However, the implementation needs to throw exceptions with specific messages:
- If the number is not 10 or 11 digits, throw with "must be 10 or 11 digits"
- If it's 11 digits but first digit is not '1', throw with "11 digits must start with 1"
- If area code doesn't start with 2-9, throw with "incorrect number of digits"
- If exchange code doesn't start with 2-9, throw with "incorrect number of digits"

Wait, but the error messages need to be precise. Let's fix:

Here are the necessary fixes:

phone_number.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "phone_number.h"

namespace phone_number {

phone_number::phone_number(const std::string& raw_number) {

            cleaned_number += c;
        }
    }
    
    // Check the length
    if (cleaned_number.length() == 11) {
        if (cleaned_number[0] != '1') {
            throw std::domain_error("Invalid country code");
        }
        // Remove the country code
        cleaned_number = cleaned_number.substr(1);
    }
    
    // Now check if the number is exactly 10 digits
    if (cleaned_number.length() != 10) {
        throw std::domain_error("Invalid number of digits");
    }
    
    // Check area code (first digit N must be 2-9)

    return cleaned_number.substr(0, 3);
}

    return "(" + area_code() + ") " + cleaned_number.substr(3, 3) + "-" + cleaned_number.substr(6);
}

    }
    
    // Check length
    if (cleaned_number.length() == 11) {
        if (cleaned_number[0] != '1') {
            throw std::domain_error("11 digits must start with 1");
        }
        // Remove the '1' prefix
        cleaned_number = cleaned_number.substr(1);
    }
    
    // After potential removal, check if we have exactly 10 digits
    if (cleaned_number.length() != 10) {

    }
    
    // Check area code starts with 2-9

    return "(" + area_code() + ") " + cleaned_number.substr(3, 3) + "-" + cleaned_number.substr(6);
}

}  // namespace phone_number
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation now:
1. Extracts all digits from the input
2. Handles numbers with 11 digits by checking if they start with '1' and removing it
3. Ensures the result is exactly 10 digits
4. Validates area code and exchange code start with digits between 2-9
5. Throws appropriate exceptions with the correct messages

However, the error messages need to match what the tests expect:
- "11 digits must start with 1" when the first digit of an 11-digit number is not '1'
- "Number must be 10 or 11 digits" when the number of digits is not 10 or 11
- "incorrect number of digits" when area code or exchange code starts with invalid digit

This should now handle all the cases correctly:
- Valid numbers with or without country code
- Invalid numbers with wrong country code
- Invalid numbers with wrong number of digits
- Invalid numbers with area code or exchange code starting with 0 or 1

Let's test our approach with provided examples:
+1 (613)-995-0253 → '1' is removed, leaving 6139950253 (valid)
613-995-0253 → 6139950253 (valid)
1 613 995 0253 → '1' is removed, leaving 6139950253 (valid)
613.995.0253 → 6139950253 (valid)
