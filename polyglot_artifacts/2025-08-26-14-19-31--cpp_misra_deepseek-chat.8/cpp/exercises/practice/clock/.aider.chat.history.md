#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a clock that handles times without dates.  
####   
#### You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.  
####   
#### Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.h clock.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a clock class that can handle time operations without dates, including adding and subtracting minutes, and ensuring that two clocks representing the same time are considered equal. Let's think through this implementation.

Since we're dealing with times, it's best to represent the time in minutes since midnight (0-1439). This makes adding and subtracting minutes straightforward, and we can normalize the time using modulo 1440 (number of minutes in a day).

However, to present the time in HH:MM format, we need to convert between total minutes and hours/minutes.

Let's implement this:

1. The clock class should store the total minutes since midnight
2. It should be able to add and subtract minutes
3. It should be able to compare for equality
4. It should be able to output in HH:MM format

Since we need to follow MISRA C++ rules, we'll use fixed-width integer types.

Here's the implementation:

First, let's update the header file to declare the clock class:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
=======
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

namespace date_independent {
    class clock {
    private:
        std::int32_t minutes;
        explicit clock(std::int32_t total_minutes);
        
    public:
        static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
        clock plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const;
        clock minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const;
        operator std::string() const;
        bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
        bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;
    };
}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the clock class in the cpp file:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {
    clock::clock(std::int32_t total_minutes) {
        // Normalize to be within 0-1439
        // Handle negative values by adding enough days to make it positive
        std::int32_t normalized_minutes = total_minutes % 1440;
        if (normalized_minutes < 0) {
            normalized_minutes += 1440;
        }
        minutes = normalized_minutes;
    }

    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        return clock(total_minutes);
    }

    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const {
        return clock(minutes + minutes_to_add);
    }

    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const {
        return clock(minutes - minutes_to_subtract);
    }

    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = minutes / 60;
        std::int32_t mins = minutes % 60;
        
        // Normalize hours to be within 0-23
        std::int32_t normalized_hours = hours % 24;
        if (normalized_hours < 0) {
            normalized_hours += 24;
        }
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << normalized_hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
        return oss.str();
    }

    bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
        return minutes == other.minutes;
    }

    bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
        return minutes != other.minutes;
    }
}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The implementation normalizes the time to always be within valid ranges (0-1439 minutes)
2. When adding or subtracting, it automatically wraps around using the clock constructor
3. The string conversion ensures proper formatting with leading zeros
4. We use fixed-width integer types as per MISRA rules

This implementation should handle:
- Adding and subtracting minutes
- Time wrapping around midnight
- Proper formatting to HH:MM
- Equality comparison

However, the instructions don't specify whether we need to handle hours beyond 0-23, but since we're always normalizing, it should be fine. The implementation always ensures the time is valid.

Wait, in the plus and minus methods, we're passing the result to the constructor which normalizes it, which is correct. This ensures that times always stay within valid ranges.

This implementation should meet all the requirements:
1. Handle times without dates
2. Add and subtract minutes
3. Two clocks representing the same time are equal (they have the same minutes value)
4. Uses proper types according to MISRA rules

Let me know if you have any questions or if there are any issues with this implementation.

I notice that the implementation needs to be adjusted to handle the normalization correctly. The issue is that when computing hours and minutes for the string representation, we're using the normalized minutes which are always between 0-1439, so hours will always be between 0-23. Therefore, we don't need to normalize hours again.

Also, the implementation needs to ensure that the minutes are always positive and within 0-1439, which it does.

However, there's a potential issue: the hours and minutes in the string conversion are computed from the normalized minutes, which are always positive, so we don't need to handle negative hours.

Let's fix the string conversion to be simpler:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = minutes / 60;
        std::int32_t mins = minutes % 60;
        
        // Normalize hours to be within 0-23
        std::int32_t normalized_hours = hours % 24;
        if (normalized_hours < 0) {
            normalized_hours += 24;
        }
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << normalized_hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
        return oss.str();
    }
=======
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        // Since minutes is always between 0-1439, hours will be between 0-23
        std::int32_t hours = minutes / 60;
        std::int32_t mins = minutes % 60;
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
        return oss.str();
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change is valid because:
1. The minutes are always normalized to be between 0-1439 in the constructor
2. Therefore, hours will always be between 0-23 (since 1439 / 60 = 23)
3. So we don't need to re-normalize hours

This implementation should now work correctly. Let's test this approach:
- When minutes is 0: hours=0, mins=0 → "00:00"
- When minutes is 1439: hours=23, mins=59 → "23:59"
- When minutes is 1440: but our constructor normalizes it to 0, which is correct

This implementation should now meet all requirements:
1. Handle times without dates
2. Add and subtract minutes (via plus and minus methods which use the constructor to normalize)
3. Two clocks are equal if their normalized minutes are equal
4. Proper string formatting

However, there's one more thing to ensure: the plus and minus operations need to handle large numbers correctly, which they do because the constructor normalizes using modulo 1440.

This implementation should now be correct. Let me know if you encounter any issues.
