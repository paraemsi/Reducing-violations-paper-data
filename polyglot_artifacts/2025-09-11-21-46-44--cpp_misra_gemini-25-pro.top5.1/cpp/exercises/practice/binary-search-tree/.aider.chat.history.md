#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Insert and search for numbers in a binary tree.  
####   
#### When we need to represent sorted data, an array does not make a good data structure.  
####   
#### Say we have the array `[1, 3, 4, 5]`, and we add 2 to it so it becomes `[1, 3, 4, 5, 2]`.  
#### Now we must sort the entire array again!  
#### We can improve on this by realizing that we only need to make space for the new item `[1, nil, 3, 4, 5]`, and then adding the item in the space we added.  
#### But this still requires us to shift many elements down by one.  
####   
#### Binary Search Trees, however, can operate on sorted data much more efficiently.  
####   
#### A binary search tree consists of a series of connected nodes.  
#### Each node contains a piece of data (e.g. the number 3), a variable named `left`, and a variable named `right`.  
#### The `left` and `right` variables point at `nil`, or other nodes.  
#### Since these other nodes in turn have other nodes beneath them, we say that the left and right variables are pointing at subtrees.  
#### All data in the left subtree is less than or equal to the current node's data, and all data in the right subtree is greater than the current node's data.  
####   
#### For example, if we had a node containing the data 4, and we added the data 2, our tree would look like this:  
####   
####       4  
####      /  
####     2  
####   
#### If we then added 6, it would look like this:  
####   
####       4  
####      / \  
####     2   6  
####   
#### If we then added 3, it would look like this  
####   
####        4  
####      /   \  
####     2     6  
####      \  
####       3  
####   
#### And if we then added 1, 5, and 7, it would look like this  
####   
####           4  
####         /   \  
####        /     \  
####       2       6  
####      / \     / \  
####     1   3   5   7  
####

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: binary_search_tree.h binary_search_tree.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not use the keywords signed/unsigned char, short, int, long, or long long (and their unsigned forms) for variables, parameters, or return types.    
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types such as std::int8_t, std::uint16_t, std::int32_t, std::uint64_t, or project-specific typedefs/aliases that wrap them.    
#### - int is permitted only for the main() return type, its parameters (argc, argv), and as the dummy int in postfix ++/-- operators; avoid it elsewhere.    
#### - Typedef/using declarations that create aliases are allowed and encouraged for readability.    
#### - Plain char is covered by another rule; avoid it for integers.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Parenthesize every sub-expression that combines binary or ternary operators with different precedence levels ( *, /, %, +, -, <<, >>, <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, &, ^, |, &&, ||, ?: ).    
#### - Omit parentheses only when adjacent operators share the exact same precedence and associativity (e.g. `a + b - c`, `x & y ^ z`).    
#### - Unary operators may remain unparenthesized when used inside a larger expression (`a * -b` is OK).    
#### - Never rely on default precedence in conditions, assignments, returns, or initializers; make evaluation order explicit: `if ((a == 1) && (b > 0))`, `val = a * (b + 1);`.    
#### - Treat overloaded operators with the same caution; add parentheses for clarity even if the rule does not mandate it.    
#### - Example pitfalls: avoid `a * b + 1`, `if (a + b != c - d)`, `if (x == 0 && y > 1)`; rewrite with parentheses.  
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep numeric assignments strictly safe: identical type category, signedness and size, or an allowed widening/constant case    
#### - OK: same category & signedness, destination wider, source is a single variable (id-expression) ‒ e.g. `uint32_t big = small8;`    
#### - OK: floating-point constant → wider floating type ‒ e.g. `long double ld = 1.0f;`    
#### - OK: integer constant/constant expression → any numeric type (or bit-field) whose range can hold the value ‒ e.g. `float f = 42;`, `uint8_t u = 255;`    
#### - Otherwise: do NOT assign, initialise, pass by value, return, or use in a `case` label    
####   • No wider→narrower size (e.g. `uint8_t u = uint32_t_val;`)    
####   • No signed↔unsigned change (e.g. `uint32_t = int32_t;`)    
####   • No integer↔floating conversion except the constant cases above    
####   • No value that exceeds target range    
#### - For widening, use a variable, not an arithmetic expression; if you must convert, use an explicit cast that yields a compliant source type first    
#### - Apply the same checks in constructors, default arguments, lambda captures, operator calls, etc. ‒ every by-value transfer counts as an assignment    
#### - Treat unscoped enums as their underlying integral type when checking these rules  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Never convert character types (‘char’, ‘signed/unsigned char’, ‘wchar_t’, ‘char16_t’, ‘char32_t’) to or from any non-character arithmetic type (int, bool, enum, float, …); forbid both implicit assignments and casts.    
#### - Do not perform arithmetic, bitwise, relational (<, >, <=, >=), or ++/-- on character objects; only == and != between identical character types are allowed.    
#### - Initialise/assign character variables exclusively with character literals of the same category (e.g., char c = '\n'; wchar_t w = L'x';), not numeric constants.    
#### - When an integer representation is unavoidable, use library helpers such as std::char_traits<CharT>::to_int_type(), never rely on direct conversion.    
#### - Use <cctype>/<cwctype> utilities (std::isalpha, std::tolower, …) instead of numeric range checks on characters.    
#### - Raw byte or small-integer data should be held in std::byte, std::uint8_t, or int8_t, not in char-family types.    
#### - Unevaluated operands (sizeof, decltype, alignof) and casts to void of a function call returning a character are permissible.  
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always wrap the body of every `if` in `{ … }`, even if it is a single statement    
#### - Always wrap the body of every `else` in `{ … }`; braces may be omitted only when the `else` is immediately followed by another `if` (`else if`)    
#### - Do not place any non-braced statement directly after `if (…)` or `else`    
#### - Never write `if (condition);` — replace with a braced empty block or remove the statement    
#### - Keep braces and indentation consistent so the controlled block is visually unambiguous  
####   
#### The numeric value of an unscoped enumeration with no fixed underlying type shall not be used  
#### - Declare enums as `enum class` or give them an explicit underlying type (e.g. `enum Mode : std::uint8_t`); avoid plain `enum Mode { … };`.  
#### - For an unscoped enum without a fixed underlying type:  
####   • Do NOT use it with any arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or compound-assignment operator.    
####   • Only compare it (`==, !=, <, >, <=, >=`) with another value of the same enum type.    
####   • In `switch (e)`, every `case` label must be an enumerator of that same enum.    
####   • Only assign/initialize/return/pass it to the same enum type; if an integral value is required, first cast to an integer type wide enough to hold every enumerator.    
####   • `static_cast` is permitted only to a sufficiently wide integer type; never cast to another enum or to a too-narrow integer.    
#### - If you need numeric manipulation, either cast the value to a wide integer first or redesign the enum as `enum class` / fixed-width to remove the restriction.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

Based on your instructions, I will implement a binary search tree. This involves defining a `binary_tree` class which represents a node in the tree and provides methods for insertion and searching.

Here are the changes for `binary_search_tree.h` and `binary_search_tree.cpp`:

In `binary_search_tree.h`, I will define the `binary_tree` class, including its public interface for construction, insertion (`insert`), searching (`search`), and accessing node data (`data`, `left`, `right`). I'll use `std::int32_t` for the node data type to comply with MISRA rules, and `std::unique_ptr` for managing child nodes.

In `binary_search_tree.cpp`, I will implement the methods declared in the header file. The `insert` method will recursively find the correct position and add a new node. The `search` method will recursively look for a value and return a pointer to the node if found, or `nullptr` otherwise. All implementations will adhere to the provided MISRA C++ rules, particularly regarding the use of braces for `if`/`else` bodies.

Here are the `SEARCH/REPLACE` blocks for the requested changes.

The issue you're encountering is a common C++ problem when using `std::unique_ptr` with an incomplete type within a class definition. Specifically, the `binary_tree` class contains `std::unique_ptr<binary_tree>` members. The compiler needs the full definition of `binary_tree` to generate the default destructor for `std::unique_ptr`, but the definition is not yet complete.

To fix this, I will:
1.  Declare a destructor for `binary_tree` in the header file (`.h`).
2.  Define this destructor in the implementation file (`.cpp`), where the `binary_tree` type is complete.
3.  In accordance with the "Rule of Five", since a destructor is being declared, I will also explicitly handle copy and move operations. The class will be made non-copyable (as `std::unique_ptr` is not copyable) and explicitly movable.

Here are the necessary changes:

```cpp
binary_search_tree.h
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    explicit binary_tree(value_type value);

    void insert(value_type value);
=======
    explicit binary_tree(value_type value);
    ~binary_tree();

    binary_tree& operator=(const binary_tree&) = delete;

    binary_tree(binary_tree&&) noexcept;
    binary_tree& operator=(binary_tree&&) noexcept;

binary_tree::binary_tree(binary_tree::value_type value)
    : tree_data{value}, left_tree{nullptr}, right_tree{nullptr} {}

The error you are seeing is likely due to how some compilers or static analysis tools handle defaulted move constructors and move assignment operators for a class that contains a `std::unique_ptr` to an incomplete type (itself, in this case).

While defining these special member functions as `= default` in the `.cpp` file is the modern, standard approach, some toolchains can still struggle with it. To resolve this, I will provide explicit implementations for the move constructor and move assignment operator. This behavior is identical to what the compiler would generate with `= default`, but writing it out explicitly can satisfy stricter compilers or linters.

I will also add parameter names to the declarations in the header file for clarity and consistency.

Here are the required changes:

```cpp
binary_search_tree.h
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    binary_tree(binary_tree&&) noexcept;
    binary_tree& operator=(binary_tree&&) noexcept;

    binary_tree(binary_tree&& other) noexcept;

    : tree_data{other.tree_data},
      left_tree{std::move(other.left_tree)},
      right_tree{std::move(other.right_tree)} {}

binary_tree& binary_tree::operator=(binary_tree&& other) noexcept {
    if (this != &other) {
        tree_data = other.tree_data;
        left_tree = std::move(other.left_tree);
        right_tree = std::move(other.right_tree);
    }
    return *this;

It appears there might be a missing header file in `binary_search_tree.cpp`. The move constructor and move assignment operator use `std::move`, which is defined in the `<utility>` header. While this function is sometimes available through other headers like `<memory>`, explicitly including `<utility>` is the correct and portable way to ensure it's available. This may resolve the issue your toolchain is reporting with the class definition.

Here is the change:

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in binary_search_tree.h binary_search_tree.cpp to resolve the errors.  

Based on the compiler errors, the tests expect `binary_tree` to be a class template that can work with different data types (like `uint32_t` and `std::string`), but it's currently implemented to only handle `std::int32_t`.

To fix this, I will:
1.  Convert the `binary_tree` class into a class template.
2.  Move the method implementations from `binary_search_tree.cpp` into `binary_search_tree.h`, as is standard practice for template classes.
3.  Update method signatures to pass larger types by constant reference to avoid unnecessary copying.
4.  Empty the implementation from `binary_search_tree.cpp`.

Here are the required changes:

```cpp
binary_search_tree.h

#include <memory>

namespace binary_search_tree {

class binary_tree {

    using value_type = std::int32_t;

    ~binary_tree();

    binary_tree& operator=(const binary_tree&) = delete;

Based on my analysis, there's a potential issue in `binary_search_tree.h` related to the use of the injected-class-name for the template. Inside the `binary_tree<T>` class definition, `binary_tree` is used as a shorthand for `binary_tree<T>`. While this is valid C++, it can sometimes cause issues with certain compilers or tools, especially in complex template scenarios like this one involving `std::unique_ptr`.

To improve clarity and ensure correctness across different compilers, I will make the template argument explicit. I'll change all occurrences of `binary_tree` to `binary_tree<T>` within the class definition for pointers and `std::unique_ptr` members.

Here is the proposed change:

```cpp
binary_search_tree.h
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const binary_tree* search(const value_type& value) const;

    const std::unique_ptr<binary_tree>& left() const;
    const std::unique_ptr<binary_tree>& right() const;
    const value_type& data() const;

private:
    value_type tree_data;
    std::unique_ptr<binary_tree> left_tree;
    std::unique_ptr<binary_tree> right_tree;

    const value_type& data() const;

    value_type tree_data;
    std::unique_ptr<binary_tree<T>> left_tree;
    std::unique_ptr<binary_tree<T>> right_tree;

The code appears to be well-formed, but there is a subtle issue regarding the `noexcept` specification on the move constructor and move assignment operator in a generic template context.

The move operations are unconditionally marked as `noexcept`. However, whether a move operation can throw depends on the properties of the template type `T`. If `binary_tree` is instantiated with a type `T` whose move operations can throw, this unconditional `noexcept` constitutes an incorrect promise to the compiler. If an exception is thrown from a move operation of `T`, the program will terminate.

To fix this, I will make the `noexcept` specifier conditional on whether `T`'s move operations are non-throwing, using `std::is_nothrow_move_constructible` and `std::is_nothrow_move_assignable` from the `<type_traits>` header.

Here are the required changes:

The code appears to have an overly complex usage of `typename` and the nested alias `value_type` in function signatures. While technically correct, this can sometimes lead to obscure compiler errors or issues with static analysis tools.

To resolve this, I will refactor the code to use the template parameter `T` directly in the function declarations and definitions. This simplifies the code, improves readability, and removes the dependency on `typename` for parameter and return types, which is a common source of template-related issues.

Here are the changes for `binary_search_tree.h`:
