#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Insert and search for numbers in a binary tree.  
####   
#### When we need to represent sorted data, an array does not make a good data structure.  
####   
#### Say we have the array `[1, 3, 4, 5]`, and we add 2 to it so it becomes `[1, 3, 4, 5, 2]`.  
#### Now we must sort the entire array again!  
#### We can improve on this by realizing that we only need to make space for the new item `[1, nil, 3, 4, 5]`, and then adding the item in the space we added.  
#### But this still requires us to shift many elements down by one.  
####   
#### Binary Search Trees, however, can operate on sorted data much more efficiently.  
####   
#### A binary search tree consists of a series of connected nodes.  
#### Each node contains a piece of data (e.g. the number 3), a variable named `left`, and a variable named `right`.  
#### The `left` and `right` variables point at `nil`, or other nodes.  
#### Since these other nodes in turn have other nodes beneath them, we say that the left and right variables are pointing at subtrees.  
#### All data in the left subtree is less than or equal to the current node's data, and all data in the right subtree is greater than the current node's data.  
####   
#### For example, if we had a node containing the data 4, and we added the data 2, our tree would look like this:  
####   
####       4  
####      /  
####     2  
####   
#### If we then added 6, it would look like this:  
####   
####       4  
####      / \  
####     2   6  
####   
#### If we then added 3, it would look like this  
####   
####        4  
####      /   \  
####     2     6  
####      \  
####       3  
####   
#### And if we then added 1, 5, and 7, it would look like this  
####   
####           4  
####         /   \  
####        /     \  
####       2       6  
####      / \     / \  
####     1   3   5   7  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: binary_search_tree.h binary_search_tree.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not use the keywords signed/unsigned char, short, int, long, or long long (and their unsigned forms) for variables, parameters, or return types.    
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types such as std::int8_t, std::uint16_t, std::int32_t, std::uint64_t, or project-specific typedefs/aliases that wrap them.    
#### - int is permitted only for the main() return type, its parameters (argc, argv), and as the dummy int in postfix ++/-- operators; avoid it elsewhere.    
#### - Typedef/using declarations that create aliases are allowed and encouraged for readability.    
#### - Plain char is covered by another rule; avoid it for integers.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Parenthesize every sub-expression that combines binary or ternary operators with different precedence levels ( *, /, %, +, -, <<, >>, <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, &, ^, |, &&, ||, ?: ).    
#### - Omit parentheses only when adjacent operators share the exact same precedence and associativity (e.g. `a + b - c`, `x & y ^ z`).    
#### - Unary operators may remain unparenthesized when used inside a larger expression (`a * -b` is OK).    
#### - Never rely on default precedence in conditions, assignments, returns, or initializers; make evaluation order explicit: `if ((a == 1) && (b > 0))`, `val = a * (b + 1);`.    
#### - Treat overloaded operators with the same caution; add parentheses for clarity even if the rule does not mandate it.    
#### - Example pitfalls: avoid `a * b + 1`, `if (a + b != c - d)`, `if (x == 0 && y > 1)`; rewrite with parentheses.  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Never convert character types (‘char’, ‘signed/unsigned char’, ‘wchar_t’, ‘char16_t’, ‘char32_t’) to or from any non-character arithmetic type (int, bool, enum, float, …); forbid both implicit assignments and casts.    
#### - Do not perform arithmetic, bitwise, relational (<, >, <=, >=), or ++/-- on character objects; only == and != between identical character types are allowed.    
#### - Initialise/assign character variables exclusively with character literals of the same category (e.g., char c = '\n'; wchar_t w = L'x';), not numeric constants.    
#### - When an integer representation is unavoidable, use library helpers such as std::char_traits<CharT>::to_int_type(), never rely on direct conversion.    
#### - Use <cctype>/<cwctype> utilities (std::isalpha, std::tolower, …) instead of numeric range checks on characters.    
#### - Raw byte or small-integer data should be held in std::byte, std::uint8_t, or int8_t, not in char-family types.    
#### - Unevaluated operands (sizeof, decltype, alignof) and casts to void of a function call returning a character are permissible.  
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep numeric assignments strictly safe: identical type category, signedness and size, or an allowed widening/constant case    
#### - OK: same category & signedness, destination wider, source is a single variable (id-expression) ‒ e.g. `uint32_t big = small8;`    
#### - OK: floating-point constant → wider floating type ‒ e.g. `long double ld = 1.0f;`    
#### - OK: integer constant/constant expression → any numeric type (or bit-field) whose range can hold the value ‒ e.g. `float f = 42;`, `uint8_t u = 255;`    
#### - Otherwise: do NOT assign, initialise, pass by value, return, or use in a `case` label    
####   • No wider→narrower size (e.g. `uint8_t u = uint32_t_val;`)    
####   • No signed↔unsigned change (e.g. `uint32_t = int32_t;`)    
####   • No integer↔floating conversion except the constant cases above    
####   • No value that exceeds target range    
#### - For widening, use a variable, not an arithmetic expression; if you must convert, use an explicit cast that yields a compliant source type first    
#### - Apply the same checks in constructors, default arguments, lambda captures, operator calls, etc. ‒ every by-value transfer counts as an assignment    
#### - Treat unscoped enums as their underlying integral type when checking these rules  
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always wrap the body of every `if` in `{ … }`, even if it is a single statement    
#### - Always wrap the body of every `else` in `{ … }`; braces may be omitted only when the `else` is immediately followed by another `if` (`else if`)    
#### - Do not place any non-braced statement directly after `if (…)` or `else`    
#### - Never write `if (condition);` — replace with a braced empty block or remove the statement    
#### - Keep braces and indentation consistent so the controlled block is visually unambiguous  
#### </rules>
