#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a clock that handles times without dates.  
####   
#### You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.  
####   
#### Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.h clock.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

I understand. Let's implement a clock that handles times without dates, allowing addition and subtraction of minutes, and ensuring that two clocks representing the same time are equal.

Since we need to use fixed-width integer types, we'll include <cstdint>. We'll represent the time in minutes since 00:00, which makes it easy to add and subtract minutes, and then normalize to a 24-hour period (1440 minutes per day).

However, to present the time in HH:MM format, we need to convert the total minutes to hours and minutes, taking modulo 1440 to handle wrapping around days.

Let's implement a Clock class with:
1. A constructor that takes hours and minutes
2. Methods to add and subtract minutes
3. Equality comparison
4. A toString method to format the time

Since the instructions mention not to change existing function names, but there are none yet, we need to implement according to the namespace.

Wait, the namespace is date_independent, and the class should probably be called clock.

Here's the implementation:

First, let's update the header file:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
=======
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

namespace date_independent {
    class clock {
    private:
        std::int32_t total_minutes;
        clock(std::int32_t minutes);
        
    public:
        static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
        clock plus(std::int32_t minutes) const;
        clock minus(std::int32_t minutes) const;
        operator std::string() const;
        bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
        bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;
    };
}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the clock.cpp file:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {
    clock::clock(std::int32_t minutes) : total_minutes(minutes) {}
    
    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        // Convert everything to minutes and normalize to a 24-hour period
        std::int32_t total = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        // Handle negative values by adding enough days to make it positive
        total %= 1440;
        if (total < 0) {
            total += 1440;
        }
        return clock(total);
    }
    
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        return clock((total_minutes + minutes) % 1440);
    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        // To subtract, we can add negative minutes and handle normalization
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (total_minutes - minutes) % 1440;
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }
    
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = total_minutes / 60;
        std::int32_t mins = total_minutes % 60;
        // Normalize hours to 0-23
        hours %= 24;
        if (hours < 0) {
            hours += 24;
        }
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
        return oss.str();
    }
    
    bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
        return total_minutes == other.total_minutes;
    }
    
    bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
        return !(*this == other);
    }
}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The plus and minus operations need to handle wrapping correctly
2. We need to ensure that the time always stays within a valid 24-hour period
3. The implementation uses modulo arithmetic to handle wrapping
4. When subtracting, we need to handle negative results by adding 1440 minutes (one day)
5. The toString implementation uses stringstream to format the time with leading zeros

This implementation should satisfy:
1. Adding and subtracting minutes
2. Equality comparison based on the time
3. Proper wrapping around midnight
4. Using fixed-width integer types as per the rules

However, the implementation of plus() and minus() needs to handle large numbers correctly. Let's test our approach:
- Adding 60 minutes to 23:59 should give 00:59
- Subtracting 5 minutes from 00:05 should give 00:00

Wait, the implementation of plus() doesn't handle negative results correctly. Let's fix that:

Wait, the implementation needs to always produce a positive number of minutes between 0 and 1439. So we need to ensure that after every operation, the total_minutes is normalized to this range.

Actually, the implementation of plus() should be modified to handle wrapping correctly:
clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    std::int32_t new_minutes = (total_minutes + minutes) % 1440;
    if (new_minutes < 0) {
        new_minutes += 1440;
    }
    return clock(new_minutes);
}

Similarly, the implementation of minus() can be:
clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    return this->plus(-minutes);
}

This is more consistent. Let's update the implementation:

Wait, the implementation above for plus() already handles negative numbers correctly, so we can implement minus() by reusing plus() with a negative value.

This implementation should now be correct. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle large numbers correctly, especially when adding or subtracting minutes that could cause multiple day wraparounds. The current implementation using modulo may not handle cases where the number of minutes added or subtracted is larger than 1440 minutes (one day).

Let's fix the implementation to always normalize the total minutes to be within 0-1439 by using proper modular arithmetic.

Here are the necessary fixes:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        return clock((total_minutes + minutes) % 1440);
    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        // To subtract, we can add negative minutes and handle normalization
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (total_minutes - minutes) % 1440;
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }
    
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = total_minutes / 60;
        std::int32_t mins = total_minutes % 60;
        // Normalize hours to 0-23
        hours %= 24;
        if (hours < 0) {
            hours += 24;
        }
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
        return oss.str();
    }
=======
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        // Handle large numbers by using modulo arithmetic
        // First, compute the new total minutes and normalize to a positive value within 0-1439
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (total_minutes + minutes) % 1440;
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        // Reuse plus by adding negative minutes
        return this->plus(-minutes);
    }
    
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        // Since total_minutes is always between 0 and 1439, we can directly compute hours and minutes
        std::int32_t hours = total_minutes / 60;
        std::int32_t mins = total_minutes % 60;
        // Ensure hours is within 0-23 (always true due to normalization)
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
        return oss.str();
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue when adding very large numbers that could cause integer overflow. But since we're using 32-bit integers and 1440 minutes per day, the maximum number of minutes we can represent is about 2^31 / 1440 ≈ 1,491,825 days which is more than enough.

Wait, the implementation of plus() needs to handle very large positive and negative numbers correctly. Let's test:
- Adding 1440 minutes should result in the same time
- Adding 2880 minutes should result in the same time
- Adding -1440 minutes should result in the same time

This implementation should work because:
1. We always normalize the total minutes to be between 0 and 1439 using modulo 1440
2. We adjust for negative results by adding 1440
3. The minus() function reuses plus() with a negative value, which is efficient and consistent

Also, the implementation of the string conversion operator can be simplified because total_minutes is always between 0 and 1439, so hours will always be between 0 and 23.

This implementation should now correctly handle:
1. Adding and subtracting any number of minutes
2. Wrapping around midnight correctly
3. Equality comparison
4. String formatting with leading zeros

Let's also ensure that the at() function handles large numbers correctly:
clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        // Convert everything to minutes and normalize to a 24-hour period
        std::int32_t total = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        // Handle negative values by adding enough days to make it positive
        total %= 1440;
        if (total < 0) {
            total += 1440;
        }
        return clock(total);
    }
=======
    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        // First, compute total minutes
        std::int32_t total_minutes_from_input = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        // Normalize to be within 0-1439
        total_minutes_from_input %= 1440;
        if (total_minutes_from_input < 0) {
            total_minutes_from_input += 1440;
        }
        return clock(total_minutes_from_input);
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation ensures that even if hours or minutes are negative or very large, the resulting time is always valid.

These changes should now make the implementation robust and correct according to the requirements.
