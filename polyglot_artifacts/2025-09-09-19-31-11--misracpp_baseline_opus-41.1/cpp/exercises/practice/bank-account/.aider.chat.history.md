#### # Introduction  
####   
#### After years of filling out forms and waiting, you've finally acquired your banking license.  
#### This means you are now officially eligible to open your own bank, hurray!  
####   
#### Your first priority is to get the IT systems up and running.  
#### After a day of hard work, you can already open and close accounts, as well as handle withdrawals and deposits.  
####   
#### Since you couldn't be bothered writing tests, you invite some friends to help test the system.  
#### However, after just five minutes, one of your friends claims they've lost money!  
#### While you're confident your code is bug-free, you start looking through the logs to investigate.  
####   
#### Ah yes, just as you suspected, your friend is at fault!  
#### They shared their test credentials with another friend, and together they conspired to make deposits and withdrawals from the same account _in parallel_.  
#### Who would do such a thing?  
####   
#### While you argue that it's physically _impossible_ for someone to access their account in parallel, your friend smugly notifies you that the banking rules _require_ you to support this.  
#### Thus, no parallel banking support, no go-live signal.  
#### Sighing, you create a mental note to work on this tomorrow.  
#### This will set your launch date back at _least_ one more day, but well...  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
####   
#### As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), your bank software must allow accounts to be safely accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.  
#### For example, there may be many deposits and withdrawals occurring in parallel; you need to ensure there are no [race conditions][wikipedia] between when you read the account balance and set the new balance.  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
####   
#### [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.cpp bank_account.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll implement a thread-safe bank account system that supports opening/closing accounts, deposits, and withdrawals. The implementation will use a mutex to ensure thread safety for parallel access.

## Changes needed:

1. **bank_account.h**: Add member variables for balance and account state, declare methods for open, close, deposit, withdraw, and balance operations, and include necessary headers for thread safety.

2. **bank_account.cpp**: Implement all the methods with proper thread synchronization using mutex to prevent race conditions.

Here are the updated files:

bank_account.h
```
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <mutex>

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {
public:
    Bankaccount();
    ~Bankaccount();
    
    void open();
    void close();
    int balance() const;
    void deposit(int amount);
    void withdraw(int amount);

private:
    mutable std::mutex account_mutex;
    int account_balance;
    bool is_open;
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
```

bank_account.cpp
```
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : account_balance(0), is_open(false) {}

Bankaccount::~Bankaccount() {}

void Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account already open");
    }
    is_open = true;
    account_balance = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account not open");
    }
    is_open = false;
}

int Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account not open");
    }
    return account_balance;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(int amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account not open");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    account_balance += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(int amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account not open");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    if (amount > account_balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    account_balance -= amount;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
```

The implementation provides:
- **Thread safety**: All operations are protected by a mutex to prevent race conditions
- **Account lifecycle**: Accounts must be opened before use and can be closed
- **Error handling**: Operations on closed accounts throw exceptions
- **Validation**: Deposits and withdrawals must be positive amounts, and withdrawals cannot exceed the balance

Looking at the marked lines, I can see two potential issues:

1. Line 14: The `balance()` method is declared as `const` but uses a mutex lock, which requires `mutable` - this is already correctly handled with the `mutable` mutex on line 19.

2. Line 18-19: The `mutable` keyword on the mutex is necessary for the `const` method to work properly.

These are actually not errors - the code is correct as written. The `mutable` keyword on line 19 allows the mutex to be locked even in `const` methods, which is the standard pattern for thread-safe const methods.

However, if there are compilation errors, they might be related to missing header includes. Let me ensure all necessary headers are included:

bank_account.h
```
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <mutex>

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {
public:
    Bankaccount();
    ~Bankaccount();
    
    void open();
    void close();
    int balance() const;
    void deposit(int amount);
    void withdraw(int amount);

private:
    mutable std::mutex account_mutex;
    int account_balance;
    bool is_open;
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
```

bank_account.cpp
```
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : account_balance(0), is_open(false) {}

Bankaccount::~Bankaccount() {}

void Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account already open");
    }
    is_open = true;
    account_balance = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account not open");
    }
    is_open = false;
}

int Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account not open");
    }
    return account_balance;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(int amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account not open");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    account_balance += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(int amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(account_mutex);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account not open");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    if (amount > account_balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    account_balance -= amount;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
```

The code structure with `mutable std::mutex` and `const` balance method is the correct pattern for thread-safe access. The `mutable` keyword allows the mutex to be modified (locked/unlocked) even in const member functions, which is necessary for thread-safe const methods.

The marked lines in the code are not errors. They show:
1. Line 14: A `const` method `balance()` - this is correct
2. Line 18-19: A `mutable` mutex - this is necessary and correct for thread-safe const methods

The code is properly structured. The `mutable` keyword on the mutex allows it to be locked even in `const` member functions like `balance()`, which is the standard C++ pattern for thread-safe const methods.

No changes are needed - the implementation is correct as written. The files already contain a complete, thread-safe bank account implementation that:
- Uses mutex for thread synchronization
- Properly handles account states (open/closed)
- Validates all operations
- Throws appropriate exceptions for error conditions

Looking at the test failures, the tests expect `std::runtime_error` to be thrown for negative deposits and withdrawals, but the current code throws `std::invalid_argument`. I need to change the exception type from `std::invalid_argument` to `std::runtime_error` for these cases.
