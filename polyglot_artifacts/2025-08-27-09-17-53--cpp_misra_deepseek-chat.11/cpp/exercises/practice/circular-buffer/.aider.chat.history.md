#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.  
####   
#### A circular buffer first starts empty and of some predefined length.  
#### For example, this is a 7-element buffer:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Assume that a 1 is written into the middle of the buffer (exact starting location does not matter in a circular buffer):  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][1][ ][ ][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then assume that two more elements are added — 2 & 3 — which get appended after the 1:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][1][2][3][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### If two elements are then removed from the buffer, the oldest values inside the buffer are removed.  
#### The two elements removed, in this case, are 1 & 2, leaving the buffer with just a 3:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][3][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### If the buffer has 7 elements then it is completely full:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [5][6][7][8][9][3][4]  
#### ```  
####   
#### When the buffer is full an error will be raised, alerting the client that further writes are blocked until a slot becomes free.  
####   
#### When the buffer is full, the client can opt to overwrite the oldest data with a forced write.  
#### In this case, two more elements — A & B — are added and they overwrite the 3 & 4:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [5][6][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### 3 & 4 have been replaced by A & B making 5 now the oldest data in the buffer.  
#### Finally, if two elements are removed then what would be returned is 5 & 6 yielding the buffer:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Because there is space available, if the client again uses overwrite to store C & D then the space where 5 & 6 were stored previously will be used not the location of 7 & 8.  
#### 7 is still the oldest element and the buffer is once again full.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [C][D][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: circular_buffer.cpp circular_buffer.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I'll analyze this carefully and implement a circular buffer according to the instructions. Let's think through the implementation:

1. We need a buffer that can store elements
2. We need to track read and write positions
3. We need to handle normal writes and overwrites
4. We need to handle reading and removing elements
5. We need to track the number of elements to know if the buffer is full

Since this is C++, we'll implement it as a class template to handle any data type.
However, the instructions don't specify the exact interface, so I'll need to make some assumptions.

Let's add the necessary includes and implement the class in the header file.

Here are the planned member variables:
- A pointer to the buffer
- The capacity
- Read and write indices
- Number of elements

Here are the planned methods:
- Constructor to create a buffer of a given size
- Destructor to clean up
- Write (normal and with overwrite)
- Read/remove
- Maybe a clear function

Wait, the instructions don't specify exact function names, but since this is likely for an exercise, we need to follow a specific interface.
Since none is provided, I'll implement standard operations.

However, the instructions say not to change existing function names, but the namespace is empty.
So I need to implement a class within the circular_buffer namespace.

Let's proceed:

Here are the necessary changes:

        }

        if (count_ < capacity_) {
            write(data);
        } else {
            buffer[write_pos_] = data;
            write_pos_ = (write_pos_ + 1) % capacity_;
            read_pos_ = (read_pos_ + 1) % capacity_;
            // count remains the same
        }
    }
    
    T read() {

        T data = buffer[read_pos_];
        read_pos_ = (read_pos_ + 1) % capacity_;
        --count_;
        return data;
    }
    
    void clear() {
        read_pos_ = 0;
        write_pos_ = 0;
        count_ = 0;
    }
    
    // Delete copy constructor and assignment operator
    circular_buffer(const circular_buffer&) = delete;
    circular_buffer& operator=(const circular_buffer&) = delete;
};

}  // namespace circular_buffer

#endif // CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H

```

However, the implementation needs to be in the .cpp file, but since it's a template, it should be in the header.
Wait, the instructions say to modify both files, but templates typically need to be in headers.

Since the .cpp file is provided, and it's empty, perhaps the implementation should be there.
But templates can't be implemented in .cpp files unless explicitly instantiated, which isn't specified.

Wait, the instructions may expect a non-template implementation, but that's not specified.
Since the instructions don't specify the type, it's probably a template.

Actually, the implementation needs to be in the header to work properly.
But the user provided both files, so perhaps they want the implementation in the .cpp file.

This is tricky. Let's implement a specific type, perhaps integers, but that's not specified.
Since the examples use numbers and letters, maybe it's templated.

Wait, the instructions say to use the existing files, and not to change function names, but there are none.
Perhaps we need to implement a specific interface that's expected by tests.

Since we don't have that information, I'll implement a template in the header.
If there are issues, we can adjust.

Wait, the user may have provided the .cpp file to implement non-template functions, but the instructions are unclear.
Since the namespace is empty, and we need to implement a circular buffer, I'll proceed with the template approach.

This implementation follows the instructions:
1. Normal write throws when full
2. Overwrite replaces oldest data when full
3. Read removes and returns the oldest element
4. Properly handles indices using modulo arithmetic

This should work according to the examples provided:
- When the buffer is full, overwrite will replace the oldest elements
- Reading removes from the front
- Indices wrap around using modulo

Let's proceed with this implementation.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to follow the MISRA C++ rules provided. Let's fix the issues:

1. Use fixed-width integer types instead of std::size_t
2. Add necessary includes
3. Ensure proper parentheses in expressions
4. Follow the assignment rules

However, std::size_t is used for array indices and sizes, which is standard in C++. But according to the rules, we should use fixed-width types.
Since the capacity can be any size, we need to choose an appropriate type. Let's use std::uint32_t which should be sufficient.

Here are the necessary fixes:

```

However, there's a potential issue: the capacity parameter in the constructor is now std::uint32_t, which might not match what the tests expect.
If the tests pass a different type, we need to handle it. But according to the rules, we need to ensure type safety.

Since the instructions say to use fixed-width types, and the user wants to follow MISRA rules, this should be fine.
If there are issues, we can adjust.

Also, note that all arithmetic operations now use unsigned integers, which is appropriate for indices.
The modulo operations use 'U' suffix to ensure they're treated as unsigned.

This implementation should now follow the provided rules:
1. Using fixed-width integer types (std::uint32_t)
2. All assignments are between compatible types
3. Added parentheses where necessary (though all expressions seem to be properly parenthesized)
4. Using appropriate numeric literals with 'U' suffix for unsigned operations

The circular_buffer.cpp file remains empty, which is fine since it's a template implementation that needs to be in the header.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to follow the provided MISRA C++ rules more strictly. Let's fix the issues:

1. The class name 'circular_buffer' matches the namespace name, which can be confusing
2. We need to ensure all operations follow the parentheses rules
3. The implementation should be in the .cpp file, not just the header
4. The tests may expect a specific interface

Wait, the instructions say not to change existing function names or classes, so the class name must remain 'circular_buffer'
But having the same name as the namespace is valid in C++.

However, the implementation needs to be non-templated, which makes sense for a .cpp file.
The examples show numbers and letters, so perhaps it's meant to store integers or characters.

Since the instructions aren't clear, and we have a .cpp file, let's implement a specific type.
Let's assume it's for integers, and we can adjust if needed.

Here's a revised approach:
1. Implement a non-template class in the header
2. Put the implementation in the .cpp file
3. Follow all MISRA rules

Wait, the tests might expect a template, but since we need to implement in .cpp, let's use int
If that's not correct, we can adjust.

Here are the necessary changes:

This implementation:
1. Uses int as the data type (adjust if needed)
2. Follows MISRA rules by using fixed-width integer types
3. Places implementation in the .cpp file
4. Adds necessary parentheses around expressions
5. Maintains the same class and function names
6. Properly handles errors with exceptions

Note: All arithmetic operations are now properly parenthesized according to the rules:
- Modulo operations are wrapped in parentheses
- Addition operations are within parentheses before modulo

This should now follow the provided guidelines while implementing the circular buffer functionality described in the instructions.

I understand. The tests expect a template implementation, not a specific type like `int`. Let's fix that by making the implementation templated and moving it to the header file.

Here are the necessary changes:

```

This implementation:
1. Makes the class a template to handle any type (as the tests expect)
2. Uses `const T&` for write and overwrite parameters to avoid unnecessary copies
3. Maintains all the functionality while following the provided rules
4. The implementation is moved to the header file because templates need to be defined in the header
5. The .cpp file is now mostly empty since the implementation is in the header

This should now work with the tests that use different types like `int` and `std::string`. The errors about `circular_buffer::circular_buffer` not being a template should be resolved, and the type mismatches when writing strings should also be fixed.

These changes ensure that:
1. All arithmetic operations are properly parenthesized according to the rules
2. The implementation remains functionally the same
3. We follow the MISRA C++ rules by always using parentheses around binary operations

The key changes are:
- Added parentheses around `(count_ + 1U)` and `(count_ - 1U)` to make the operations explicit
- Kept the existing parentheses around the modulo operations which were already correct

This should now comply with the provided rules while maintaining the correct functionality of the circular buffer.

The main changes are:
1. Added `buffer(nullptr)` to the initializer list to ensure all member variables are initialized
2. Kept the parentheses around arithmetic operations to ensure proper precedence
3. Maintained the same functionality while following the rules

This implementation should now comply with the MISRA C++ rules:
1. All member variables are initialized in the constructor's initializer list
2. Parentheses are used to make operator precedence explicit
3. The implementation remains functionally correct

The implementation is already in the header file due to being a template, which is correct. The .cpp file can remain as is since it doesn't need to contain anything for a template implementation.

I understand. The implementation needs to follow the MISRA C++ rules more strictly. Let's fix the issues:

1. The initializer list order should match the declaration order
2. Add parentheses to ensure proper operator precedence
3. Make sure all operations are clear and follow the rules

Here are the necessary fixes:

The main change is reordering the initializer list to match the declaration order:
1. `buffer` is declared first, so it should be initialized first
2. Then `capacity_`, `read_pos_`, `write_pos_`, and `count_` follow in order

This ensures compliance with MISRA C++ rules about initialization order matching declaration order. The rest of the implementation remains the same as it already follows the other rules:
1. Using parentheses to make operator precedence explicit
2. Using fixed-width integer types
3. Proper error handling with exceptions

This implementation should now fully comply with the provided MISRA C++ rules while maintaining the correct functionality of the circular buffer.
