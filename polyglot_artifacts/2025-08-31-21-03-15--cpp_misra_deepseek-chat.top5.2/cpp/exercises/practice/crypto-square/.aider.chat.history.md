#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement the classic method for composing secret messages called a square code.  
####   
#### Given an English text, output the encoded version of that text.  
####   
#### First, the input is normalized: the spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the message is down-cased.  
####   
#### Then, the normalized characters are broken into rows.  
#### These rows can be regarded as forming a rectangle when printed with intervening newlines.  
####   
#### For example, the sentence  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "If man was meant to stay on the ground, god would have given us roots."  
#### ```  
####   
#### is normalized to:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "ifmanwasmeanttostayonthegroundgodwouldhavegivenusroots"  
#### ```  
####   
#### The plaintext should be organized into a rectangle as square as possible.  
#### The size of the rectangle should be decided by the length of the message.  
####   
#### If `c` is the number of columns and `r` is the number of rows, then for the rectangle `r` x `c` find the smallest possible integer `c` such that:  
####   
#### - `r * c >= length of message`,  
#### - and `c >= r`,  
#### - and `c - r <= 1`.  
####   
#### Our normalized text is 54 characters long, dictating a rectangle with `c = 8` and `r = 7`:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "ifmanwas"  
#### "meanttos"  
#### "tayonthe"  
#### "groundgo"  
#### "dwouldha"  
#### "vegivenu"  
#### "sroots  "  
#### ```  
####   
#### The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right.  
####   
#### The message above is coded as:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvsfearwermayoogoanouuiontnnlvtwttddesaohghnsseoau"  
#### ```  
####   
#### Output the encoded text in chunks that fill perfect rectangles `(r X c)`, with `c` chunks of `r` length, separated by spaces.  
#### For phrases that are `n` characters short of the perfect rectangle, pad each of the last `n` chunks with a single trailing space.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn  sseoau "  
#### ```  
####   
#### Notice that were we to stack these, we could visually decode the ciphertext back in to the original message:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvs"  
#### "fearwer"  
#### "mayoogo"  
#### "anouuio"  
#### "ntnnlvt"  
#### "wttddes"  
#### "aohghn "  
#### "sseoau "  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: crypto_square.cpp crypto_square.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I'll analyze this problem and implement the solution while following the given rules. Let's break it down:

1. Normalize the input: remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
2. Determine the number of columns (c) and rows (r) that satisfy:
   r * c >= length
   c >= r
   c - r <= 1
3. Organize the normalized text into a grid with r rows and c columns, padding with spaces if necessary
4. Read down the columns to get the encoded message, and then split into chunks of r characters

Since we need to work with the C++ standard library, we'll need to include appropriate headers.

However, the function signatures aren't provided, so I need to infer them. Let's assume we need a class or function to encode the text.

Wait, the instructions say not to change the names of existing functions or classes, but the namespace is empty. So we need to add a function to the namespace.

Let's add a function called `cipher` that takes a string and returns the encoded string.

Here's the implementation plan:
1. Normalize the input
2. Calculate r and c
3. Pad the normalized string to make its length exactly r*c
4. Build the encoded string by reading columns
5. Split into chunks separated by spaces

Here are the necessary changes:

crypto_square.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CRYPTO_SQUARE_H)
#define CRYPTO_SQUARE_H

namespace crypto_square {

}  // namespace crypto_square

#endif // CRYPTO_SQUARE_H
=======
#if !defined(CRYPTO_SQUARE_H)
#define CRYPTO_SQUARE_H

#include <string>

namespace crypto_square {

std::string cipher(const std::string& text);

}  // namespace crypto_square

#endif // CRYPTO_SQUARE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation:

crypto_square.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "crypto_square.h"

namespace crypto_square {

}  // namespace crypto_square
=======
#include "crypto_square.h"
#include <string>
#include <cctype>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

namespace crypto_square {

std::string cipher(const std::string& text) {
    // Normalize the input
    std::string normalized;
    for (char ch : text) {
        if (std::isalnum(static_cast<unsigned char>(ch))) {
            normalized += std::tolower(static_cast<unsigned char>(ch));
        }
    }
    
    // Handle empty string
    if (normalized.empty()) {
        return "";
    }
    
    // Calculate number of columns (c) and rows (r)
    const std::int32_t length = static_cast<std::int32_t>(normalized.size());
    std::int32_t c = static_cast<std::int32_t>(std::ceil(std::sqrt(static_cast<double>(length))));
    std::int32_t r = static_cast<std::int32_t>(std::ceil(static_cast<double>(length) / static_cast<double>(c)));
    
    // Adjust to meet conditions
    // Ensure c >= r and c - r <= 1
    // Since c is ceiling(sqrt(n)), and r is ceiling(n/c), these conditions should be satisfied
    // But let's verify
    // For the example, length=54: sqrt(54)≈7.35 → c=8, r=ceil(54/8)=7 which satisfies c>=r and c-r=1<=1
    
    // Pad the normalized string to make it exactly r*c characters
    normalized.append(static_cast<std::size_t>(r * c - length), ' ');
    
    // Build the encoded text by reading down the columns
    std::string encoded;
    for (std::int32_t i = 0; i < c; ++i) {
        for (std::int32_t j = 0; j < r; ++j) {
            encoded += normalized[j * c + i];
        }
    }
    
    // Split into chunks of r characters separated by spaces
    std::string result;
    for (std::int32_t i = 0; i < static_cast<std::int32_t>(encoded.size()); ++i) {
        if ((i != 0) && ((i % r) == 0)) {
            result += ' ';
        }
        result += encoded[i];
    }
    
    return result;
}

}  // namespace crypto_square
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to include <cctype> for character functions
2. We need to cast characters to unsigned char for std::isalnum and std::tolower to avoid UB
3. We're using integer types according to the rules
4. We're following the conditions to find r and c
5. We're padding with spaces to make the length exactly r*c
6. We're building the result by reading down columns
7. We're adding spaces between chunks

This implementation should work for the provided example:
1. Normalize: "ifmanwasmeanttostayonthegroundgodwouldhavegivenusroots" (length 54)
2. c = ceil(sqrt(54)) = 8, r = ceil(54/8) = 7
3. Pad to 56 characters (add 2 spaces)
4. Organize into a grid and read down columns
5. Split into chunks of 7 characters separated by spaces

Wait, the example output has chunks of 7 characters, which matches r=7:
"imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn  sseoau "

This matches our implementation. Let's proceed.

I understand. The issue is that the function signature needs to be consistent with the implementation. Let's fix that.

However, the implementation needs to be adjusted to meet the requirements:
1. The number of columns (c) and rows (r) must satisfy:
   r * c >= length of message
   c >= r
   c - r <= 1
2. We need to find the smallest possible integer c that satisfies these conditions

The implementation needs to find the correct r and c values that meet all conditions, not just use ceil(sqrt(n))

Let's fix the implementation:

Here's the revised approach:
1. Find the smallest c where c >= ceil(sqrt(n)) and find r = ceil(n/c)
2. Check if c >= r and c - r <= 1
3. If not, adjust c and r until conditions are satisfied

Wait, the conditions must always be true, so we need to find the smallest c that satisfies:
c >= ceil(sqrt(n))
r = ceil(n/c)
c >= r
c - r <= 1

Since c >= ceil(sqrt(n)), and r = ceil(n/c), and n <= c*r
But to always satisfy c >= r and c - r <= 1, we need to find the right c

Actually, for a given length, we can find r and c by:
Start with r = floor(sqrt(n)), c = ceil(n/r)
But this may not satisfy c >= r and c - r <= 1
So we need to find the right combination

Wait, the instructions say to find the smallest possible integer c such that:
r * c >= length
c >= r
c - r <= 1

Since r is floor(length/c) or ceil(length/c)? No, r can be determined based on c
Let's find c first, then r = ceil(length/c)

Let's find the smallest c where c >= ceil(sqrt(length)) and ceil(length/c) <= c and c - ceil(length/c) <= 1

Here's the fixed implementation:

```

This implementation should now correctly find the smallest c that satisfies all the given conditions:
1. r * c >= length of the normalized message
2. c >= r
3. c - r <= 1

For the example:
Normalized length is 54
We need to find c where ceil(54/c) <= c and c - ceil(54/c) <= 1
Let's find c=8: ceil(54/8)=7, 8>=7 and 8-7=1<=1 → valid
So c=8, r=7

This matches the example, and the implementation will find these values correctly.

This should now work according to the requirements. Let me know if there are any issues.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in crypto_square.cpp crypto_square.h to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests expect a class with a `normalized_cipher_text()` method, but our implementation provides a simple function. Let's fix this by creating a class that can be instantiated with the input text and provides the required method.

Here's what we need to do:
1. Create a class (probably called `cipher`) that takes the text in its constructor
2. Implement a `normalized_cipher_text()` method that returns the encoded string
3. The implementation should follow the same logic as before

This implementation now uses a class approach which matches what the tests expect:
1. The constructor normalizes the input text
2. The `normalized_cipher_text()` method processes the normalized text to produce the encoded result
3. We use a temporary string for padding to avoid modifying the member variable

This should now work with the test cases which are calling:
```cpp
crypto_square::cipher("text").normalized_cipher_text()
```

Let's hope this resolves the compilation errors. The implementation logic remains the same, but it's now structured in a class-based approach.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to match the test cases. Let's fix the implementation to produce the correct output format.

The tests expect the result to be in chunks separated by spaces, where each chunk has exactly 'r' characters, and the last few chunks may have trailing spaces to fill them out.

However, the implementation needs to ensure that the number of columns and rows are correct. Let's fix the implementation:

Here's the revised approach:
1. Normalize the text by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase
2. Determine the number of columns (c) and rows (r) that satisfy:
   c >= r
   c - r <= 1
   r * c >= length of normalized text
3. Organize into a grid, padding with spaces if necessary
4. Read down the columns to form the encoded text
5. Split into 'c' chunks of 'r' characters each, separated by spaces

Wait, the number of chunks should be equal to the number of columns (c), and each chunk should have 'r' characters
So we need to split the encoded text into 'c' parts, each of length 'r'

Here's the fixed implementation:

crypto_square.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
std::string cipher::normalized_cipher_text() const {
    // Handle empty string
    if (normalized_.empty()) {
        return "";
    }
    
    const std::int32_t length = static_cast<std::int32_t>(normalized_.size());
    
    // Find the smallest c that satisfies all conditions
    std::int32_t c = 0;
    std::int32_t r = 0;
    for (std::int32_t temp_c = 1; temp_c <= length; ++temp_c) {
        std::int32_t temp_r = static_cast<std::int32_t>(std::ceil(static_cast<double>(length) / static_cast<double>(temp_c)));
        if ((temp_c >= temp_r) && ((temp_c - temp_r) <= 1)) {
            if ((temp_c * temp_r) >= length) {
                c = temp_c;
                r = temp_r;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Pad the normalized string to make it exactly r*c characters
    std::string temp_normalized = normalized_;
    temp_normalized.append(static_cast<std::size_t>(r * c - length), ' ');
    
    // Build the encoded text by reading down the columns
    std::string encoded;
    for (std::int32_t i = 0; i < c; ++i) {
        for (std::int32_t j = 0; j < r; ++j) {
            encoded += temp_normalized[j * c + i];
        }
    }

    std::string result;
    for (std::int32_t i = 0; i < static_cast<std::int32_t>(encoded.size()); ++i) {
        if ((i != 0) && ((i % r) == 0)) {

This implementation should now correctly handle:
1. Finding the appropriate number of columns and rows
2. Padding the normalized text
3. Reading down the columns to encode
4. Formatting the result into space-separated chunks

However, there's a potential issue: the number of rows and columns must always satisfy c >= r and c - r <= 1
Let's test our approach with the example:
Normalized length is 54
sqrt(54) ≈ 7.35 → round to 7
r = 7, c = 7 → 7*7=49 < 54 → c=8
Now check conditions: c=8 >= r=7 and 8-7=1 <=1 → valid

This matches the example:
8 columns, 7 rows → 8 chunks of 7 characters each

This implementation should now work correctly. Let's hope this resolves any issues.
