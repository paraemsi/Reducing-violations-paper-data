#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.  
####   
#### `a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.  
#### The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.  
#### The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.  
####   
#### The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:  
#### `(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,  
#### `(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.  
####   
#### Multiplication result is by definition  
#### `(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.  
####   
#### The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is  
#### `1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:  
#### `(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Raising e to a complex exponent can be expressed as `e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`, the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,  
#### - conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.  
####   
#### Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: complex_numbers.cpp complex_numbers.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

```

The SEARCH section must exactly match an existing block of lines including all white space, comments, indentation, docstrings, etc
