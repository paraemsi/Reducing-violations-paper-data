I need the expected interface to implement for this exercise.

Please add the test file(s) that reference meetup.h to the chat (with their full path names), so I can match the exact function/class names and return types.

If you don't have tests handy, please confirm one of the following interfaces:

Option A (std::chrono):
- namespace meetup
- enum class weekday { Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday }
- enum class schedule { first, second, third, fourth, last, teenth }
- class scheduler {
    public:
      scheduler(int year, int month);
      std::chrono::year_month_day day(weekday wd, schedule sc) const;
  };

Option B (return day-of-month only):
- Same as above, but day(...) returns int (the day of month).

Once confirmed or tests are provided, I'll implement meetups using only the C++ standard library.
