#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: space_age.cpp space_age.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a class that can calculate a person's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

First, we need to define a class that can store the age in seconds and provide methods to get the age on each planet. Since the orbital periods are given in Earth years, we can calculate the age on each planet by dividing the Earth years age by the orbital period ratio.

Since one Earth year is 31,557,600 seconds, we can first compute the age in Earth years, and then divide by each planet's orbital period to get the age on that planet.

However, the instructions say not to change existing functions or classes, but the namespace seems empty. Let's implement a class within the space_age namespace.

Wait, the tests probably expect a specific interface. Let's implement a class that takes seconds in its constructor and provides member functions for each planet.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a class `space_age` in the header
2. Implement it in the cpp file
3. Add member functions for each planet

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    const std::int64_t age_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(std::int64_t seconds);
    std::int64_t seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation in space_age.cpp, we need to include <cstdint> and implement each function:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"
#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(std::int64_t seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

std::int64_t space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all the calculations are precise. Since we're dealing with floating point numbers, using double precision should be fine. Also, I've added explicit casts to ensure we don't have integer division issues.

This implementation should work by:
1. First converting the age in seconds to Earth years by dividing by 31,557,600
2. Then dividing that result by the orbital period of each planet to get the age on that planet

Wait, the instructions say to use fixed-width integer types, which I've done by using std::int64_t for the seconds. All other types are floating point, which should be fine.

This implementation should now be able to handle the example where 1,000,000,000 seconds equals approximately 31.69 Earth years, and then calculate the corresponding ages for other planets.

I understand. The issue is that `std::int64_t` is not declared. We need to include the `<cstdint>` header in the `.h` file to use `std::int64_t`. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    const std::int64_t age_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(std::int64_t seconds);
    std::int64_t seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    const std::int64_t age_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(std::int64_t seconds);
    std::int64_t seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds the necessary include for `std::int64_t` to be recognized in the header file. Now, all uses of `std::int64_t` will be valid.

I understand. The implementation looks correct, but to ensure precision and follow best practices, let's use precise values and perhaps define constants for the orbital periods. However, the implementation seems correct. Let's check if there are any issues with the calculations.

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but perhaps the tests expect a certain precision. Let's make sure all floating point operations are precise by using literals with sufficient precision.

Actually, the implementation looks fine. But to make sure, let's use the exact values provided in the instructions:

Wait, the orbital periods are:
Mercury: 0.2408467
Venus: 0.61519726
Earth: 1.0
Mars: 1.8808158
Jupiter: 11.862615
Saturn: 29.447498
Uranus: 84.016846
Neptune: 164.79132

And Earth year in seconds: 31557600

The implementation matches these values. But perhaps we need to ensure the order of operations is correct. Let's add parentheses to make sure the division order is correct.

Wait, the implementation uses:
(age_seconds / 31557600.0) / orbital_period
Which is correct: first get Earth years, then divide by the orbital period to get planet years

But to be precise, we can write it as:
age_seconds / (31557600.0 * orbital_period)
This may be more efficient and precise

Let's update the implementation:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 0.2408467;

    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 0.61519726;

    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0;
}

    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / (31557600.0 * 164.79132);
}

```

This change uses a single division operation which might be more precise and efficient. It also follows the mathematical relationship more directly:
age on planet = (age in seconds) / (seconds per Earth year * orbital period)

This should produce the same results but might be more precise due to fewer floating point operations.

However, if the tests are still failing, there might be precision issues. Let's make sure we're using the exact values from the instructions:
- 31557600 seconds per Earth year
- The exact orbital periods provided

This implementation should now be correct. Let's hope this fixes any issues.
