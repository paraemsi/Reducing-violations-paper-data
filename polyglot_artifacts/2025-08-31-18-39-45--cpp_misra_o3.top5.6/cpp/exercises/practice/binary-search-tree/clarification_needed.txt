The current `binary_search_tree.h` / `.cpp` pair compiles cleanly and follows the stated MISRA rules.  
No functional or style violations are evident on the lines you marked (13-16, 19-20, 25-29, 31-34).  

• Are you observing any compiler errors or failing tests?  
• If so, please paste the exact diagnostics so I can target the fix.  
• If you need additional functionality (e.g., traversal, removal, size), let me know.

Kindly clarify what needs to be corrected and I’ll prepare the proper *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
