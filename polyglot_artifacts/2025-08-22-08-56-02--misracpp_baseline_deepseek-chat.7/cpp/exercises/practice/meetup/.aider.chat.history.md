#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Every month, your partner meets up with their best friend.  
#### Both of them have very busy schedules, making it challenging to find a suitable date!  
#### Given your own busy schedule, your partner always double-checks potential meetup dates with you:  
####   
#### - "Can I meet up on the first Friday of next month?"  
#### - "What about the third Wednesday?"  
#### - "Maybe the last Sunday?"  
####   
#### In this month's call, your partner asked you this question:  
####   
#### - "I'd like to meet up on the teenth Thursday; is that okay?"  
####   
#### Confused, you ask what a "teenth" day is.  
#### Your partner explains that a teenth day, a concept they made up, refers to the days in a month that end in '-teenth':  
####   
#### - 13th (thirteenth)  
#### - 14th (fourteenth)  
#### - 15th (fifteenth)  
#### - 16th (sixteenth)  
#### - 17th (seventeenth)  
#### - 18th (eighteenth)  
#### - 19th (nineteenth)  
####   
#### As there are also seven weekdays, it is guaranteed that each day of the week has _exactly one_ teenth day each month.  
####   
#### Now that you understand the concept of a teenth day, you check your calendar.  
#### You don't have anything planned on the teenth Thursday, so you happily confirm the date with your partner.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to find the exact date of a meetup, given a month, year, weekday and week.  
####   
#### There are five week values to consider: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, `last`, `teenth`.  
####   
#### For example, you might be asked to find the date for the meetup on the first Monday in January 2018 (January 1, 2018).  
####   
#### Similarly, you might be asked to find:  
####   
#### - the third Tuesday of August 2019 (August 20, 2019)  
#### - the teenth Wednesday of May 2020 (May 13, 2020)  
#### - the fourth Sunday of July 2021 (July 25, 2021)  
#### - the last Thursday of November 2022 (November 24, 2022)  
#### - the teenth Saturday of August 1953 (August 15, 1953)  
####   
#### ## Teenth  
####   
#### The teenth week refers to the seven days in a month that end in '-teenth' (13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th).  
####   
#### If asked to find the teenth Saturday of August, 1953, we check its calendar:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
####     August 1953  
#### Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
####                    1  
####  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  
####  9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
#### 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  
#### 23 24 25 26 27 28 29  
#### 30 31  
#### ```  
####   
#### From this we find that the teenth Saturday is August 15, 1953.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: meetup.h meetup.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I understand. We need to implement a function that can find the exact date for a meetup based on the year, month, weekday, and week specification. Let's think about how to approach this.

Since the week can be "first", "second", "third", "fourth", "last", or "teenth", we need to handle each case differently:
1. For "teenth": find the day between 13-19 that matches the given weekday
2. For others: find the nth occurrence of the weekday in the month
3. For "last": find the last occurrence of the weekday in the month

However, the function signature isn't provided, so we need to define it. Let's assume it should return a boost::gregorian::date or similar, but since we're using standard libraries, we can use <ctime> or <chrono> which can be tricky. Let's use the C++11 <chrono> library which can handle dates.

Wait, but the instructions don't specify which date library to use. Since this seems to be from an exercise, perhaps we need to implement our own date logic.

Actually, let's use the <ctime> header which provides date manipulation functions. But it's a bit tricky to work with.

Wait, the year could be from the past or future, so we need to be careful about leap years, etc.

Let's implement a function that takes year, month, week, and weekday, and returns the day of the month.

First, let's define the interface in the header file.

Here's the plan:
1. Parse the weekday and week from strings
2. For each day in the relevant range, check if it matches the weekday
3. Find the appropriate one based on the week specification

Here are the necessary changes:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

namespace meetup {

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
=======
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>

namespace meetup {

class scheduler {
public:
    scheduler(int year, int month);
    boost::gregorian::date meetup_day(int week_day, const std::string& desc) const;
private:
    int year_;
    int month_;
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation, we need to handle the week specifications:
1. Convert weekday to a number (Monday=1, ..., Sunday=7)
2. For "teenth": check days 13-19
3. For "first", "second", etc.: find the nth occurrence
4. For "last": find the last occurrence

Here's the implementation:

meetup.cpp
```cpp

#include "meetup.h"
#include <string>

namespace meetup {

using namespace boost::gregorian;

scheduler::scheduler(int year, int month) : year_(year), month_(month) {}

date scheduler::meetup_day(int week_day, const std::string& desc) const {
    // First day of the month
    date first_day(year_, month_, 1);
    // Last day of the month
    date last_day = first_day.end_of_month();
    
    // Map week day numbers (Monday=1, Sunday=7)
    // week_day is passed as an integer which should match these values
    
    if (desc == "teenth") {
        // Check days 13 to 19
        for (int day = 13; day <= 19; day++) {
            date current(year_, month_, day);
            if (current.day_of_week() == week_day) {
                return current;
            }
        }
    } else {
        // For first, second, third, fourth, last
        int week_index;
        if (desc == "first") week_index = 1;
        else if (desc == "second") week_index = 2;
        else if (desc == "third") week_index = 3;
        else if (desc == "fourth") week_index = 4;
        else if (desc == "last") week_index = -1;
        else throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid week description");
        
        if (week_index != -1) {
            int count = 0;
            for (day_iterator it = day_iterator(first_day); it <= last_day; ++it) {
                if (it->day_of_week() == week_day) {
                    count++;
                    if (count == week_index) {
                        return *it;
                    }
                }
            }
        } else {
            // Find the last occurrence
            date result;
            for (day_iterator it = day_iterator(first_day); it <= last_day; ++it) {
                if (it->day_of_week() == week_day) {
                    result = *it;
                }
            }
            return result;
        }
    }
    throw std::runtime_error("No valid date found");
}

}  // namespace meetup
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's an issue: the function signature uses `int week_day`, but the instructions suggest we need to handle weekdays as strings. But the tests may pass integers that correspond to boost's date_time weekday enumeration where:
Monday=1, Tuesday=2, ..., Sunday=7

Wait, the implementation needs to be adjusted to match how it's called. Since we don't have the exact test cases, we need to be careful.

This implementation should work, but let's make sure:
1. The week_day parameter is an integer matching boost's day_of_week enum
2. The desc parameter is one of the specified strings

This implementation should handle all cases:
- "first", "second", "third", "fourth": find the nth occurrence of the weekday
- "last": find the last occurrence of the weekday
- "teenth": find the weekday that falls on the 13th-19th

However, if there are issues, we may need to adjust. Let's proceed with this approach.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle the weekdays properly. The `meetup_day` function is being called with an integer `week_day`, but it should probably be handling the weekday in a different way. Since the tests may be expecting specific behavior, let's make sure we're using the correct approach.

However, the implementation needs to find dates based on string descriptions of weekdays (like "Monday", "Tuesday", etc.) and week specifications (like "first", "second", etc.). But the function signature uses `int week_day`, which suggests that the weekday may be passed in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the integer corresponds to the day of the week where Monday=1, Tuesday=2, ..., Sunday=7, which matches boost's gregorian::greg_weekday values.

But the implementation needs to be adjusted to use this correctly. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Make sure we're comparing the integer to the day_of_week() value correctly
2. The day_of_week() returns a greg_weekday which can be compared to an integer using its as_number() method

Wait, in boost::gregorian, date::day_of_week() returns a greg_weekday, which can be implicitly converted to an integer where:
Sunday=0, Monday=1, ..., Saturday=6
But our implementation expects Monday=1, ..., Sunday=7

This is a mismatch! Let's fix this.

Wait, the tests may be passing week_day where Monday=1, ..., Sunday=7
But boost uses Sunday=0, Monday=1, ..., Saturday=6
So we need to adjust the comparison

Here are the fixes:

This implementation now correctly handles the mapping between the integer week_day parameter (where Monday=1, ..., Sunday=7) and boost's day_of_week() which returns Sunday=0, Monday=1, ..., Saturday=6.

However, there's a potential issue: if week_day is 7 (which should represent Sunday), we map it to 0 to match boost's Sunday value. For other days, they match directly (Monday=1, Tuesday=2, etc.).

This should now correctly find:
1. The teenth day that matches the target weekday
2. The first, second, third, fourth occurrences of the target weekday
3. The last occurrence of the target weekday

Let's hope this implementation passes the tests. If there are further issues, we may need to see specific error messages to debug.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in meetup.h meetup.cpp to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests are calling methods like `monteenth()`, `first_monday()`, etc. on the scheduler class, but our implementation has a single `meetup_day()` method. We need to implement all these specific methods.

Let's fix this by adding all the required methods to the scheduler class. Since there are 7 days of the week and 5 week specifications (first, second, third, fourth, last) plus teenth, that's 7 * 6 = 42 methods!

But to make this manageable, we can use a helper function. Let's implement this:

Here are the necessary changes:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>

namespace meetup {

class scheduler {
public:
    scheduler(int year, int month);
    boost::gregorian::date meetup_day(int week_day, const std::string& desc) const;
private:
    int year_;
    int month_;
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
=======
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>
#include <string>

namespace meetup {

class scheduler {
public:
    scheduler(int year, int month);
    
    // Teenth days
    boost::gregorian::date monteenth() const;
    boost::gregorian::date tuesteenth() const;
    boost::gregorian::date wednesteenth() const;

    boost::gregorian::date first_tuesday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date first_wednesday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date first_thursday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date first_friday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date first_saturday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date first_sunday() const;
    
    // Second week days
    boost::gregorian::date second_monday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date second_tuesday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date second_wednesday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date second_thursday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date second_friday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date second_saturday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date second_sunday() const;
    
    // Third week days
    boost::gregorian::date third_monday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date third_tuesday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date third_wednesday() const;

    boost::gregorian::date third_sunday() const;
    
    // Fourth week days
    boost::gregorian::date fourth_monday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date fourth_tuesday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date fourth_wednesday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date fourth_thursday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date fourth_friday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date fourth_saturday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date fourth_sunday() const;
    
    // Last week days
    boost::gregorian::date last_monday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date last_tuesday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date last_wednesday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date last_thursday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date last_friday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date last_saturday() const;
    boost::gregorian::date last_sunday() const;
    
private:

    int month_;
    boost::gregorian::date find_date(int week_day, const std::string& desc) const;
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation, we'll create a helper function `find_date` that can find dates based on the weekday and description, and then implement all the methods to call this helper:

meetup.cpp

    // The week_day parameter seems to be 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, ..., 7=Sunday

    int target_dow;
    if (week_day == 7) {
        target_dow = 0; // Sunday
    } else {

        for (int day = 13; day <= 19; day++) {

            if (current.day_of_week() == target_dow) {
                return current;
            }
        }
    } else {

        int week_index;
        if (desc == "first") week_index = 1;
        else if (desc == "second") week_index = 2;
        else if (desc == "third") week_index = 3;

This implementation should now match what the tests expect. Each method calls the helper function `find_date` with the appropriate parameters:
- The target day of the week (using boost's numbering: Sunday=0, Monday=1, etc.)
- The week specification ("first", "second", etc. or "teenth")

This should now pass the tests. Let's hope this works!

I see the issue. There's an extra closing brace and namespace declaration at the end of meetup.cpp. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
}  // namespace meetup

}  // namespace meetup
=======
}  // namespace meetup
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This should resolve the compilation error by removing the duplicate closing brace and namespace declaration.
