#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.  
####   
#### `a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.  
#### The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.  
#### The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.  
####   
#### The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:  
#### `(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,  
#### `(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.  
####   
#### Multiplication result is by definition  
#### `(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.  
####   
#### The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is  
#### `1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:  
#### `(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Raising e to a complex exponent can be expressed as `e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`, the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,  
#### - conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.  
####   
#### Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: complex_numbers.cpp complex_numbers.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I'll implement a complex number class with the required operations. Let's start by defining the class structure and then implement each operation.

Since we need to use fixed-width integer types, we'll include <cstdint>. However, complex numbers typically use floating-point types, so we'll use double for real and imaginary parts.

Here's the plan:
1. Define a Complex class with real and imaginary parts
2. Implement constructors
3. Implement arithmetic operations as member functions
4. Implement conjugate, abs, and exp as member functions

Wait, the instructions say to implement addition, subtraction, etc. of two complex numbers, which suggests these should be operators.
But the implementation needs to be in a namespace, not a class? Or perhaps both?

Since the files are empty, I need to define everything from scratch.

Let's implement:

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag) : real_(real), imag_(imag) {}
    double real() const { return real_; }
    double imag() const { return imag_; }
    
    // Arithmetic operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Other operations
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the member functions in the .cpp file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "complex_numbers.h"

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
#include "complex_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ + other.real_), (imag_ + other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ - other.real_), (imag_ - other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}

Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_, -imag_);
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex(magnitude * std::cos(imag_), magnitude * std::sin(imag_));
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all operations follow the MISRA rules:
1. No standard integer types: We're using double which is fine
2. Assignment between numeric types: All assignments are between doubles
3. Parentheses: Added parentheses to ensure proper precedence
4. Compound statements: All function bodies are compound statements
5. Character numerical values: Not using any characters

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are implemented using operator overloading
- Conjugate, absolute value, and exponent are implemented as member functions
- All operations follow the mathematical definitions provided

However, the instructions say to implement operations on two complex numbers, which we've done through operator overloading. This seems appropriate.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to follow the MISRA C++ rules, particularly regarding the use of parentheses to indicate operator precedence. Let's carefully review each operation to ensure proper parenthesization.

However, looking at the implementation, most operations seem to be using parentheses appropriately. But to be thorough, let's make sure all binary operations are properly parenthesized when they are part of other operations.

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but perhaps the issue is with the use of member functions vs. non-member functions? Or maybe the interface needs to be different?

Actually, the instructions say to implement operations on two complex numbers, which could mean they should be non-member functions. But the implementation uses member functions which is also valid.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Maybe the issue is with the constructor or accessors? Let's make sure all operations are properly parenthesized according to MISRA rules.

Let's carefully add parentheses to ensure all operations follow the rules:

Here are the necessary fixes:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ + other.real_), (imag_ + other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {

}

    return Complex((magnitude * std::cos(imag_)), (magnitude * std::sin(imag_)));
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Wait, the main change here is adding parentheses around the negation of imag_ in conj() and around the multiplications in exp(). But these may not be necessary according to the rules:
- Unary operators don't need extra parentheses
- Multiplication has higher precedence than addition, so it's fine

But to be thorough, let's ensure all binary operations are properly parenthesized when they are operands of other operations.

Actually, the implementation seems correct. Perhaps the issue is that the accessor functions real() and imag() need to be used instead of directly accessing real_ and imag_? But the implementation uses them within the class, so direct access is fine.

Wait, the instructions might be expecting non-member functions. Let's check if we need to provide non-member operator overloads. But the implementation uses member functions which is standard.

Perhaps the issue is with the interface. Let's make sure all functions are properly declared and implemented.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the issue is that the tests expect certain functions to be non-member. But since the instructions don't specify, and the implementation uses a class, it should be fine.

Since the implementation seems correct, and the only potential issues are with parentheses, I've added them where appropriate. Let's hope this satisfies the requirements.

#### Fix the code in complex_numbers.cpp complex_numbers.h to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests are trying to perform operations between Complex numbers and doubles, which our implementation doesn't support. We need to add these operations. Let's implement them as non-member functions to allow for proper type conversions.

Since the tests are using expressions like `c + 5.0` and `5.0 + c`, we need to provide both member and non-member operator overloads. However, for member functions, the left operand must be of the class type, so `5.0 + c` won't work with member functions. Therefore, we need to implement non-member functions.

Let's add the necessary non-member operator overloads:

Here are the required changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag) : real_(real), imag_(imag) {}
    double real() const { return real_; }
    double imag() const { return imag_; }
    
    // Arithmetic operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Other operations
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag) : real_(real), imag_(imag) {}
    double real() const { return real_; }
    double imag() const { return imag_; }
    
    // Arithmetic operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Operations with doubles
    Complex operator+(double other) const;
    Complex operator-(double other) const;
    Complex operator*(double other) const;
    Complex operator/(double other) const;
    
    // Other operations
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
};

// Non-member operators to handle double + Complex cases
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these new operators in the .cpp file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex((magnitude * std::cos(imag_)), (magnitude * std::sin(imag_)));
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
Complex Complex::operator+(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ + other), imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ - other), imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ * other), (imag_ * other));
}

Complex Complex::operator/(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ / other), (imag_ / other));
}

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs + rhs.real()), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs - rhs.real()), (-rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real()), (lhs * rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To compute lhs / (a + bi), we can use the formula for division
    // Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate
    double denominator = (rhs.real() * rhs.real()) + (rhs.imag() * rhs.imag());
    double real_part = (lhs * rhs.real()) / denominator;
    double imag_part = (-lhs * rhs.imag()) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex((magnitude * std::cos(imag_)), (magnitude * std::sin(imag_)));
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should now handle all the cases where doubles are mixed with Complex numbers in arithmetic operations:
1. Complex + double
2. double + Complex
3. Complex - double
4. double - Complex
5. Complex * double
6. double * Complex
7. Complex / double
8. double / Complex

The implementation follows the mathematical rules:
- Adding/subtracting a real number only affects the real part
- Multiplying/dividing by a real number scales both real and imaginary parts
- Dividing a real number by a complex number uses the conjugate to find the reciprocal

This should now pass all the test cases that were failing. Let's hope this resolves the issues.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to follow the MISRA C++ rules, particularly regarding the use of parentheses to indicate operator precedence. Let's carefully review each operation to ensure proper parenthesization.

However, the implementation seems to be mostly correct. Let's make sure all binary operations are properly parenthesized when they are part of other operations. Let's also ensure that all function bodies use compound statements.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Perhaps the issue is that the non-member operator functions need to be declared as friends or need to be defined in a way that they can access private members. But they're using the public accessor functions, which is fine.

Actually, the implementation seems correct. Let's make sure all operations are properly parenthesized according to MISRA rules:

Here are the necessary fixes to ensure proper parenthesization:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::operator+(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ + other), imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ - other), imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ * other), (imag_ * other));
}

Complex Complex::operator/(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ / other), (imag_ / other));
}

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs + rhs.real()), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs - rhs.real()), (-rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real()), (lhs * rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To compute lhs / (a + bi), we can use the formula for division
    // Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate
    double denominator = (rhs.real() * rhs.real()) + (rhs.imag() * rhs.imag());
    double real_part = (lhs * rhs.real()) / denominator;
    double imag_part = (-lhs * rhs.imag()) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
=======
Complex Complex::operator+(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ + other), imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ - other), imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ * other), (imag_ * other));
}

Complex Complex::operator/(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_ / other), (imag_ / other));
}

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs + rhs.real()), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs - rhs.real()), ((-rhs.imag())));
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real()), (lhs * rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To compute lhs / (a + bi), we can use the formula for division
    // Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate
    double denominator = (rhs.real() * rhs.real()) + (rhs.imag() * rhs.imag());
    double real_part = (lhs * rhs.real()) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((-lhs) * rhs.imag()) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The main changes are:
1. Added extra parentheses around `-rhs.imag()` to ensure proper precedence
2. Added parentheses around `-lhs` to ensure it's treated as a single unit

These changes ensure that all operations follow the MISRA C++ rules regarding operator precedence and parentheses usage.

However, the implementation seems correct otherwise. Let's hope these minor adjustments resolve any potential issues.
