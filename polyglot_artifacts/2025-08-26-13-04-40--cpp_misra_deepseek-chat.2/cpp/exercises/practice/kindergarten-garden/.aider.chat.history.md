#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The kindergarten class is learning about growing plants.  
#### The teacher thought it would be a good idea to give the class seeds to plant and grow in the dirt.  
#### To this end, the children have put little cups along the window sills and planted one type of plant in each cup.  
#### The children got to pick their favorites from four available types of seeds: grass, clover, radishes, and violets.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to, given a diagram, determine which plants each child in the kindergarten class is responsible for.  
####   
#### There are 12 children in the class:  
####   
#### - Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve, Fred, Ginny, Harriet, Ileana, Joseph, Kincaid, and Larry.  
####   
#### Four different types of seeds are planted:  
####   
#### | Plant  | Diagram encoding |  
#### | ------ | ---------------- |  
#### | Grass  | G                |  
#### | Clover | C                |  
#### | Radish | R                |  
#### | Violet | V                |  
####   
#### Each child gets four cups, two on each row:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### ........................ # each dot represents a cup  
#### ........................  
#### ```  
####   
#### Their teacher assigns cups to the children alphabetically by their names, which means that Alice comes first and Larry comes last.  
####   
#### Here is an example diagram representing Alice's plants:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VR......................  
#### RG......................  
#### ```  
####   
#### In the first row, nearest the windows, she has a violet and a radish.  
#### In the second row she has a radish and some grass.  
####   
#### Your program will be given the plants from left-to-right starting with the row nearest the windows.  
#### From this, it should be able to determine which plants belong to each student.  
####   
#### For example, if it's told that the garden looks like so:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV  
#### VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then if asked for Alice's plants, it should provide:  
####   
#### - Violets, radishes, violets, radishes  
####   
#### While asking for Bob's plants would yield:  
####   
#### - Clover, grass, clover, clover  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: kindergarten_garden.cpp kindergarten_garden.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. Let's implement a solution to determine which plants each child is responsible for based on the given diagram. Since there are 12 children, and each child gets 4 cups (2 from each row), we need to parse the diagram accordingly.

The diagram consists of two lines, each with 2 * 12 = 24 characters (since each child gets 2 cups per row). We can split each row into 12 parts, with each part having 2 plants. Then, for each child, we can take the first two plants from the first row and the first two plants from the second row.

Since the children are ordered alphabetically, we can map their names to indices:
Alice -> 0, Bob -> 1, ..., Larry -> 11

Let's implement a function that takes a child's name and the diagram, and returns their plants.

However, the implementation needs to be in C++, and we need to follow the given rules.

Wait, the function signature isn't specified. Let's assume we need to implement a function that takes a string (child's name) and a string (the diagram), and returns a list of plants.

Since the plants are represented by characters, we can map them to their full names:
'G' -> "Grass", 'C' -> "Clover", 'R' -> "Radishes", 'V' -> "Violets"

Let's implement:

Here's the plan:
1. Split the diagram into two rows
2. For each row, split into 12 parts, each of 2 characters
3. Find the index of the child based on their name
4. Get the 2 plants from each row at that index
5. Convert each plant character to its full name

Here are the necessary changes:

First, let's add the necessary includes and function signatures:

kindergarten_garden.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#pragma once

namespace kindergarten_garden {

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
=======
#pragma once
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

namespace kindergarten_garden {

    std::vector<std::string> plants(const std::string& diagram, const std::string& student);

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, implement the function in the cpp file:

kindergarten_garden.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "kindergarten_garden.h"

namespace kindergarten_garden {

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
=======
#include "kindergarten_garden.h"
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <sstream>
#include <cstdint>

namespace kindergarten_garden {

std::vector<std::string> plants(const std::string& diagram, const std::string& student) {
    // List of children in order
    const std::vector<std::string> children = {
        "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David",
        "Eve", "Fred", "Ginny", "Harriet",
        "Ileana", "Joseph", "Kincaid", "Larry"
    };
    
    // Find the index of the student
    int32_t index = -1;
    for (int32_t i = 0; i < static_cast<int32_t>(children.size()); i++) {
        if (children[i] == student) {
            index = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // Split the diagram into two rows
    std::istringstream iss(diagram);
    std::string row1, row2;
    std::getline(iss, row1);
    std::getline(iss, row2);
    
    // Each child has 2 plants per row, so their plants are at index*2 and index*2 +1
    std::vector<char> plant_chars;
    plant_chars.push_back(row1[static_cast<size_t>(index) * 2]);
    plant_chars.push_back(row1[static_cast<size_t>(index) * 2 + 1]);
    plant_chars.push_back(row2[static_cast<size_t>(index) * 2]);
    plant_chars.push_back(row2[static_cast<size_t>(index) * 2 + 1]);
    
    // Map each plant character to its full name
    std::map<char, std::string> plant_map = {
        {'G', "Grass"},
        {'C', "Clover"},
        {'R', "Radishes"},
        {'V', "Violets"}
    };
    
    std::vector<std::string> result;
    for (const auto& c : plant_chars) {
        result.push_back(plant_map[c]);
    }
    
    return result;
}

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The diagram may be provided with newlines, which we need to split on
2. We need to ensure index is valid
3. We need to follow the MISRA rules, which we are doing by using int32_t

Wait, the example shows the diagram is provided as a single string, which may contain newline characters, so splitting on '\n' is appropriate.

This implementation should work for the provided examples:
- For Alice (index 0), we take positions 0 and 1 from both rows
- For Bob (index 1), we take positions 2 and 3 from both rows

Let's test this approach with the provided example:
Diagram:
"VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV\nVRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV"

Alice's plants:
Row 1: V, R at positions 0,1
Row 2: V, R at positions 0,1
But according to the example, it should be Violets, radishes, violets, radishes
Wait, the implementation takes two from each row, which matches:
V, R from first row, V, R from second row
But the example says "violet and radish" then "radish and grass" which doesn't match
Wait, perhaps I misread the example.

Actually, the implementation seems correct, and the initial explanation may have been different.
Wait, the implementation always takes from the same index in both rows, which matches the problem statement.

This implementation should work. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle cases where the index might be invalid, and to ensure it follows the problem requirements. Let's fix that.

However, the error might be due to the index being -1 if the student name isn't found, which would lead to accessing negative indices. Since the problem states that the children are always from the fixed list, and the student will always be one of them, we can assume index will always be valid.

Wait, but to be safe, we should handle cases where the student name isn't found, but according to the problem, it should always be valid.

Let's proceed to fix the implementation:

1. Make sure to include the necessary headers
2. Use a more efficient way to find the index
3. Ensure all types are appropriate

Here are the necessary fixes:

```

This implementation:
1. Always finds a valid index (since student is always one of the children)
2. Uses at() for map access which will throw if the key is not found (but according to the problem, all plant codes are valid)
3. Properly handles the diagram parsing
4. Follows the required type rules

However, to make sure the implementation is robust, we need to ensure that:
1. The diagram always has two lines
2. Each line has at least 24 characters (12 children * 2 plants each)
3. All plant codes are valid

Since the problem guarantees these conditions, we can proceed.

I understand. The tests expect an enum type `Plants` to be used, but our implementation returns `std::vector<std::string>`. Let's fix that by defining the `Plants` enum and using it.

Here are the necessary changes:

    result.push_back(plant_map.at(row1[static_cast<size_t>(start_pos) + 1]));
    // Add plants from second row
    result.push_back(plant_map.at(row2[static_cast<size_t>(start_pos)]));

```

This implementation now:
1. Uses the `Plants` enum as required by the tests
2. Returns `std::array<Plants, 4>` instead of `std::vector<std::string>`
3. Maps the plant codes to the appropriate enum values
4. Maintains the same logic for parsing the diagram and finding the child's plants

The enum values match what the tests expect (all lowercase):
- clover
- grass
- radishes
- violets

This should now work with the provided tests. Let's hope this resolves the compilation errors.

I understand. The issue is that the enum names need to match exactly what the tests expect. The tests are using `Plants::radishes`, `Plants::clover`, etc., which suggests the enum values are being used directly. Let's make sure everything matches.

However, the implementation looks correct. Let's check if there are any issues with the implementation:
1. The diagram may have newlines, which we're handling by splitting into two lines
2. The index calculation seems correct
3. The plant mapping seems correct

Wait, the tests might be expecting the plants in a specific order. The problem says:
1. The first two plants come from the first row
2. The next two plants come from the second row
3. Within each row, plants are ordered from left to right

This matches our implementation.

Let's make sure we're including all necessary headers and that the implementation is correct.

Wait, the implementation uses `std::istringstream` which requires `<sstream>`, which is included.
All seems fine.

Perhaps the issue is that the enum needs to be defined in a way that the tests can access it. Let's make sure the implementation is correct.

Wait, the implementation may be accessing out of bounds if the diagram is not valid. Let's add some checks.

Wait, the problem guarantees the input is valid, so we don't need to worry about that.

Let's run through an example:
For Alice (index 0), we take positions 0 and 1 from both rows
This matches the problem statement

Wait, the tests may be case-sensitive about the enum values. Let's make sure they match exactly:
clover, grass, radishes, violets

This matches our implementation.

Perhaps the issue is that the function signature needs to be different. Let's make sure we're using the right types.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Let's try to see if there are any issues with indexing:
The index is found by comparing to the list of children, which is correct
The start_pos is index * 2, which is correct

Wait, the diagram may have Windows line endings (\r\n) which could affect parsing
Let's handle that by trimming \r characters

Here's a revised implementation:

```

This implementation now handles potential '\r' characters that might be present in the diagram string, which could be causing parsing issues. This is common when dealing with input that may come from different platforms.

However, if the tests are still failing, there might be other issues:
1. The order of plants might be different than expected
2. The index calculation might be off
3. The enum values might need to be in a specific order

Since the tests are correct, and we can't change them, we need to make sure our implementation matches their expectations exactly. Let's hope this fix resolves any issues with parsing the diagram.
