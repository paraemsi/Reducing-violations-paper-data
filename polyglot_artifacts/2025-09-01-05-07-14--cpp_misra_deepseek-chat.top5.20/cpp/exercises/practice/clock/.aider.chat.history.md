#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a clock that handles times without dates.  
####   
#### You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.  
####   
#### Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.cpp clock.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

I understand. Let's implement a clock that handles times without dates, supporting addition and subtraction of minutes, and equality comparison. We'll need to represent the time in hours and minutes, and normalize it to always be within valid ranges (0-23 hours, 0-59 minutes).

Since we need to use fixed-width integer types, we'll include <cstdint> and use appropriate types. Let's implement a Clock class that can be constructed from hours and minutes, and provide methods to add and subtract minutes.

However, the instructions don't specify the exact interface, but typically, we need:
1. A way to create a clock at a specific time
2. Add minutes
3. Subtract minutes
4. Compare for equality
5. Convert to a string representation

Since the namespace is date_independent, we'll put our implementation there.

Let's start with the header file:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
=======
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

namespace date_independent {
    class clock {
    private:
        std::int32_t total_minutes;
        clock(std::int32_t minutes);
    public:
        static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
        clock plus(std::int32_t minutes) const;
        clock minus(std::int32_t minutes) const;
        operator std::string() const;
        bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
        bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;
    };
}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the clock.cpp file:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {
    clock::clock(std::int32_t minutes) : total_minutes(minutes) {}
    
    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        // Normalize to total minutes, then adjust to be within 0-1439 (minutes per day)
        std::int32_t total = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        // Ensure total is non-negative by adding enough days
        total %= 1440;
        if (total < 0) {
            total += 1440;
        }
        return clock(total);
    }
    
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        return clock((total_minutes + minutes) % 1440);
    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        // To subtract, we can add negative minutes and normalize
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (total_minutes - minutes) % 1440;
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }
    
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = (total_minutes / 60) % 24;
        std::int32_t mins = total_minutes % 60;
        
        // Format to HH:MM
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
        return oss.str();
    }
    
    bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
        return total_minutes == other.total_minutes;
    }
    
    bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
        return total_minutes != other.total_minutes;
    }
}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The implementation needs to handle wrapping around days correctly
2. When adding or subtracting minutes, we need to ensure the result is always within 0-1439 minutes (one day)
3. The string representation should always be in HH:MM format with leading zeros

Wait, the implementation of plus() needs to handle negative values correctly:
When adding minutes, the result could be more than 1440 minutes, which would wrap around to the next day(s)
Similarly, when subtracting, it could go negative

But the implementation above uses modulo which handles wrapping, but we need to ensure it's always positive
Let's fix that:

Wait, the implementation of plus() needs to handle large numbers correctly:
(total_minutes + minutes) could be very large, and modulo 1440 will always give a result between 0-1439
But if it's negative, we need to adjust

Actually, to always get a positive result, we can do:
((total_minutes + minutes) % 1440 + 1440) % 1440

But to avoid integer overflow, we need to be careful. Since 1440 is 24*60, and total_minutes is always between 0-1439,
and minutes can be any int32_t, we need to handle large numbers correctly.

However, this implementation should work within the constraints:
total_minutes is always between 0-1439, so adding minutes could make it up to 1439 + INT32_MAX
But modulo operation should still work correctly

Wait, to always get a positive result, we can use:
std::int32_t new_total = (total_minutes + minutes) % 1440;
if (new_total < 0) new_total += 1440;

This should work. Let's update the plus() implementation:

Wait, the implementation above for plus() doesn't handle negative results correctly. Let's fix it:

Wait, the implementation I provided for plus() is:
return clock((total_minutes + minutes) % 1440);

This can result in negative values, which is bad. Let's fix it:

Wait, the implementation should be:
clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    std::int32_t new_minutes = (total_minutes + minutes) % 1440;
    if (new_minutes < 0) {
        new_minutes += 1440;
    }
    return clock(new_minutes);
}

This ensures the result is always between 0-1439. Let's update the implementation.

However, the implementation above for plus() and minus() now correctly handles wrapping. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle all cases correctly, especially when adding or subtracting minutes. Let's fix the implementation:

The key is to always keep total_minutes within 0-1439 (number of minutes in a day)
When adding or subtracting, we need to handle wrapping around correctly

Here are the necessary fixes:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        return clock((total_minutes + minutes) % 1440);
    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        // To subtract, we can add negative minutes and normalize
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (total_minutes - minutes) % 1440;
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }
=======
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        // Handle large numbers by taking modulo 1440 to wrap around days
        // Ensure the result is always positive
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (total_minutes + minutes) % 1440;
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        // To subtract, it's the same as adding negative minutes
        return this->plus(-minutes);
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's another issue: when computing hours in the string conversion, we need to make sure hours are always between 0-23
Since total_minutes is always between 0-1439, hours will always be between 0-23, so (total_minutes / 60) % 24 is redundant
Let's fix that:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = (total_minutes / 60) % 24;
        std::int32_t mins = total_minutes % 60;
        
        // Format to HH:MM
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
        return oss.str();
    }
=======
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = total_minutes / 60;
        std::int32_t mins = total_minutes % 60;
        
        // Format to HH:MM
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
        return oss.str();
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Wait, since total_minutes is always between 0-1439, hours will always be between 0-23, which is correct
So we don't need the % 24

Also, the implementation of at() needs to handle cases where hours or minutes are negative
Let's fix that by always normalizing to a positive number of minutes within a day

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        // Normalize to total minutes, then adjust to be within 0-1439 (minutes per day)
        std::int32_t total = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        // Ensure total is non-negative by adding enough days
        total %= 1440;
        if (total < 0) {
            total += 1440;
        }
        return clock(total);
    }
=======
    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        // Convert everything to minutes and normalize to be within 0-1439
        std::int32_t total_minutes_from_input = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        // Normalize to a positive number within a day
        // Modulo operation can give negative results, so adjust if necessary
        std::int32_t normalized_minutes = total_minutes_from_input % 1440;
        if (normalized_minutes < 0) {
            normalized_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(normalized_minutes);
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should now handle all cases correctly:
1. Adding and subtracting minutes, including large values that wrap around multiple days
2. Handling negative inputs to at()
3. Always producing valid times between 00:00 and 23:59
4. Properly comparing clocks for equality

Let's also make sure to follow the MISRA rules:
1. We're using std::int32_t which is appropriate
2. All assignments are between the same types
3. We're using parentheses where necessary
4. All if statements have compound statement bodies
5. We're not using character numerical values

This implementation should now be correct and follow all the specified rules.
