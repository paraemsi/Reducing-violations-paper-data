#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.  
####   
#### `a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.  
#### The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.  
#### The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.  
####   
#### The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:  
#### `(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,  
#### `(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.  
####   
#### Multiplication result is by definition  
#### `(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.  
####   
#### The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is  
#### `1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:  
#### `(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Raising e to a complex exponent can be expressed as `e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`, the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,  
#### - conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.  
####   
#### Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: complex_numbers.h complex_numbers.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I'll implement a complex number class with the required operations. Let's start by defining the class structure in the header file and implementing the methods in the source file.

Since we need to use floating point numbers, we'll use `double` for the real and imaginary parts. However, according to the rules, we need to be careful about types. Since `double` is a standard floating point type, it should be fine.

Here are the planned operations:
1. Constructor to initialize real and imaginary parts
2. Real() and imag() accessors
3. Operator overloads for +, -, *, /
4. Conjugate, abs(), and exp() functions

Wait, the instructions mention implementing exponent, which seems to be e^z where z is complex. So we need to implement that as well.

Let's proceed:

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_part;
    double imag_part;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these methods in the source file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "complex_numbers.h"

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
#include "complex_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

Complex::Complex(double real, double imag) : real_part(real), imag_part(imag) {}

double Complex::real() const {
    return real_part;
}

double Complex::imag() const {
    return imag_part;
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_part * real_part) + (imag_part * imag_part));
}

Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_part, -imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_part);
    return Complex(magnitude * std::cos(imag_part), magnitude * std::sin(imag_part));
}

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_part + other.real_part, imag_part + other.imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_part - other.real_part, imag_part - other.imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    // (a + bi)*(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
    double real = (real_part * other.real_part) - (imag_part * other.imag_part);
    double imag = (real_part * other.imag_part) + (imag_part * other.real_part);
    return Complex(real, imag);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    // (a + bi)/(c + di) = [(ac + bd)/(c^2 + d^2)] + [(bc - ad)/(c^2 + d^2)]i
    double denominator = (other.real_part * other.real_part) + (other.imag_part * other.imag_part);
    double real = ((real_part * other.real_part) + (imag_part * other.imag_part)) / denominator;
    double imag = ((imag_part * other.real_part) - (real_part * other.imag_part)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real, imag);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all operations follow the parentheses rules:
1. Always parenthesize binary operations when they are part of other operations
2. Make sure to use parentheses to clearly indicate precedence

Looking at the implementation, I've used parentheses where necessary to ensure proper evaluation order:
- In `abs()`: (real_part * real_part) + (imag_part * imag_part)
- In `operator*()`: (real_part * other.real_part) - (imag_part * other.imag_part)
- In `operator/()`: multiple uses of parentheses to ensure proper grouping

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
1. Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
2. Conjugate, absolute value, and exponent
3. All using proper floating point precision

Note: The implementation uses `std::exp`, `std::cos`, and `std::sin` from the `<cmath>` header which are standard library functions.

I understand. The implementation needs to match the interface. Since the provided interface doesn't include a `Complex` class, but the implementation does, there must be a mismatch. Let me look at the implementation to understand what's expected.

Wait, the implementation uses a `Complex` class, but perhaps the tests expect functions that work with a different structure. Since the instructions say not to change existing function names, and the header doesn't show any functions, there must be a misunderstanding.

Actually, the provided header shows a `Complex` class, which matches the implementation. So perhaps the issue is that the implementation needs to be adjusted to match the exact interface in the header.

However, the implementation seems to match the header. Let's make sure all operations are correctly implemented according to the instructions.

Wait, the instructions say to implement:
- addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers
- conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number

All these are present in the implementation. Let's check for any potential issues:

1. The `exp()` function should be a member function that returns e raised to the current complex number
2. All operations should handle edge cases, like division by zero
3. The implementation should be numerically stable

Since the implementation uses `std::exp`, `std::cos`, and `std::sin`, which are standard, this should be fine.

However, the division operation could potentially divide by zero if the denominator is zero. But the instructions don't specify how to handle this, so we'll assume valid inputs.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Let's run through some examples to verify:
1. Addition: (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i
2. Subtraction: (a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i
3. Multiplication: (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
4. Division: ((ac + bd)/(c² + d²)) + ((bc - ad)/(c² + d²))i
5. Conjugate: a - bi
6. Absolute value: sqrt(a² + b²)
7. Exponent: e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))

All these match the implementation.

Since the implementation seems correct, perhaps the issue is with the parentheses rules from the MISRA guidelines. Let's ensure all expressions are properly parenthesized:

Wait, according to the rules:
- Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression
- Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level

Let's fix any potential issues:

Here are the necessary fixes:

    double magnitude = std::exp(real_part);
    return Complex((magnitude * std::cos(imag_part)), (magnitude * std::sin(imag_part)));
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that all binary operations are properly parenthesized according to the rules:
1. Added extra parentheses around sums before passing them to functions
2. Ensured that all binary operations are properly grouped
3. Maintained the same mathematical correctness

This should now comply with the MISRA C++ rules provided. Let me know if there are any further issues.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in complex_numbers.h complex_numbers.cpp to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests expect to be able to perform operations between complex numbers and real numbers (doubles). We need to add overloads for these operations. Let's implement them.

Since we can't change the test cases, we need to add non-member operator overloads to handle cases where a double is on the left side of the operation. These should be friends of the Complex class to access private members.

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_part;
    double imag_part;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_part;
    double imag_part;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Add operators for Complex + double, etc.
    Complex operator+(double other) const;
    Complex operator-(double other) const;
    Complex operator*(double other) const;
    Complex operator/(double other) const;
};

// Add non-member operators for double + Complex, etc.
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these new operators in the source file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    // (a + bi)/(c + di) = [(ac + bd)/(c^2 + d^2)] + [(bc - ad)/(c^2 + d^2)]i
    double denominator = ((other.real_part * other.real_part) + (other.imag_part * other.imag_part));
    double real = (((real_part * other.real_part) + (imag_part * other.imag_part)) / denominator);
    double imag = (((imag_part * other.real_part) - (real_part * other.imag_part)) / denominator);
    return Complex(real, imag);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    // (a + bi)/(c + di) = [(ac + bd)/(c^2 + d^2)] + [(bc - ad)/(c^2 + d^2)]i
    double denominator = ((other.real_part * other.real_part) + (other.imag_part * other.imag_part));
    double real = (((real_part * other.real_part) + (imag_part * other.imag_part)) / denominator);
    double imag = (((imag_part * other.real_part) - (real_part * other.imag_part)) / denominator);
    return Complex(real, imag);
}

// Member operators for Complex op double
Complex Complex::operator+(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_part + other), imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_part - other), imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_part * other), (imag_part * other));
}

Complex Complex::operator/(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_part / other), (imag_part / other));
}

// Non-member operators for double op Complex
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs + rhs.real()), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs - rhs.real()), (-rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real()), (lhs * rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To compute lhs / (a + bi), which is the same as lhs * conjugate / (a^2 + b^2)
    double denominator = ((rhs.real() * rhs.real()) + (rhs.imag() * rhs.imag()));
    double real = ((lhs * rhs.real()) / denominator);
    double imag = (((-lhs) * rhs.imag()) / denominator);
    return Complex(real, imag);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes add the necessary operators to handle operations between complex numbers and doubles:
1. Member operators for when the complex number is on the left side of the operation
2. Non-member operators for when the double is on the left side of the operation

This should now handle all the test cases:
- `c + 5.0` uses the member operator+
- `5.0 + c` uses the non-member operator+
- And similarly for other operations

Note: The implementation of division between a double and a complex number uses the formula:
lhs / (a + bi) = lhs * (a - bi) / (a² + b²) = (lhs*a)/(a² + b²) + (-lhs*b)/(a² + b²)i

This matches the mathematical definition and should work correctly. Let's hope this resolves all the test errors.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to ensure all operations are properly parenthesized according to the MISRA rules. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_part + other.real_part, imag_part + other.imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_part - other.real_part, imag_part - other.imag_part);
}
=======
Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_part + other.real_part), (imag_part + other.imag_part));
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_part - other.real_part), (imag_part - other.imag_part));
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Member operators for Complex op double
Complex Complex::operator+(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_part + other), imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_part - other), imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_part * other), (imag_part * other));
}

Complex Complex::operator/(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_part / other), (imag_part / other));
}

// Non-member operators for double op Complex
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs + rhs.real()), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs - rhs.real()), (-rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real()), (lhs * rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To compute lhs / (a + bi), which is the same as lhs * conjugate / (a^2 + b^2)
    double denominator = ((rhs.real() * rhs.real()) + (rhs.imag() * rhs.imag()));
    double real = ((lhs * rhs.real()) / denominator);
    double imag = (((-lhs) * rhs.imag()) / denominator);
    return Complex(real, imag);
}
=======
// Member operators for Complex op double
Complex Complex::operator+(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_part + other), imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_part - other), imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_part * other), (imag_part * other));
}

Complex Complex::operator/(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_part / other), (imag_part / other));
}

// Non-member operators for double op Complex
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs + rhs.real()), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs - rhs.real()), ((-rhs.imag())));
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real()), (lhs * rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To compute lhs / (a + bi), which is the same as lhs * conjugate / (a^2 + b^2)
    double denominator = ((rhs.real() * rhs.real()) + (rhs.imag() * rhs.imag()));
    double real = ((lhs * rhs.real()) / denominator);
    double imag = (((-lhs) * rhs.imag()) / denominator);
    return Complex(real, imag);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that all binary operations are properly parenthesized:
1. Added parentheses around addition and subtraction operations
2. Ensured that unary minus operations are properly handled with parentheses
3. Maintained mathematical correctness while following the MISRA rules

However, there's an issue with `(-rhs.imag())` in the subtraction operator. Let's fix that by adding parentheses:

Wait, the expression `-rhs.imag()` is a unary operation, which according to the rules doesn't need extra parentheses beyond normal usage. But to be consistent, we can wrap it to make sure it's clear.

Wait, the rules say:
"Unary operators (-x, !x, *ptr, &var, cast, etc.) do not need extra parentheses beyond normal usage."

So `-rhs.imag()` is fine as is, but to be extra careful, we can add parentheses around the whole expression to ensure it's treated as a single unit when used in other operations.

This implementation should now comply with all the MISRA C++ rules while providing the necessary functionality to pass the tests.
