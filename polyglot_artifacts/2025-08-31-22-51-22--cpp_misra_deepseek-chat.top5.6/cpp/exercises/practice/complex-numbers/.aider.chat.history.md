#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.  
####   
#### `a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.  
#### The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.  
#### The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.  
####   
#### The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:  
#### `(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,  
#### `(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.  
####   
#### Multiplication result is by definition  
#### `(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.  
####   
#### The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is  
#### `1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:  
#### `(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Raising e to a complex exponent can be expressed as `e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`, the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,  
#### - conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.  
####   
#### Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: complex_numbers.h complex_numbers.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I'll implement a complex number class with the required operations. Let's start by defining the class structure in the header file and then implement the methods in the source file.

Since we need to use floating point numbers, we'll use `double` for the real and imaginary parts. However, according to the rules, we need to be careful about types. Since `double` is a standard floating point type, it should be fine.

Here are the planned operations:
1. Constructor to initialize real and imaginary parts
2. Real() and Imag() accessors
3. operator+ for addition
4. operator- for subtraction
5. operator* for multiplication
6. operator/ for division
7. conj() for conjugate
8. abs() for absolute value
9. exp() for exponentiation

Let's implement:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement each method in the source file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "complex_numbers.h"

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
#include "complex_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

Complex::Complex(double real, double imag) : real_(real), imag_(imag) {}

double Complex::real() const {
    return real_;
}

double Complex::imag() const {
    return imag_;
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}

Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_, -imag_);
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex(magnitude * std::cos(imag_), magnitude * std::sin(imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_ + other.real_, imag_ + other.imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_ - other.real_, imag_ - other.imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    // (a + bi) * (c + di) = (a*c - b*d) + (b*c + a*d)i
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    // (a + bi) / (c + di) = [(a*c + b*d)/(c^2 + d^2)] + [(b*c - a*d)/(c^2 + d^2)]i
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation follows the mathematical definitions provided:
1. Addition and subtraction are straightforward
2. Multiplication uses the formula (ac - bd) + (bc + ad)i
3. Division uses the reciprocal approach
4. Conjugate flips the sign of the imaginary part
5. Absolute value uses the Pythagorean theorem
6. Exponential uses Euler's formula

However, I need to ensure that all operations are properly parenthesized according to the rules:
- All binary operations are properly parenthesized to indicate precedence
- The implementation uses compound statements for all if/else, but there are no if/else statements in this implementation
- All types are appropriate (using double for real numbers)
- No character operations are used

This implementation should meet all the requirements and follow the provided rules. Let me know if you need any adjustments!

I understand. The implementation needs to match the interface. Since the provided interface doesn't use a class but the implementation does, there must be a mismatch. Let me look at the implementation to see what's expected.

Wait, the implementation uses a class, but perhaps the tests expect functions that work on complex numbers directly. But the instructions say not to change existing function names, which suggests there may be a different interface.

Since the provided header shows a class, but the implementation may be expected to work differently, I need to be careful. Let's implement the functions to work with complex numbers as a type.

However, the implementation needs to match the interface. Let's see:

The implementation uses a class, which matches the header. So it should be fine. But perhaps there are errors in the implementation that need to be fixed.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Let's check if there are any issues:
1. All operations are implemented according to the mathematical definitions
2. Proper use of const
3. Proper use of member functions

Since the implementation seems correct, perhaps the issue is with the interface. But the user says to not change existing function names, which suggests the interface is fixed.

Wait, the implementation may need to be adjusted to match the tests. Since we don't see the tests, we need to ensure our implementation follows the instructions precisely.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Let's make sure all operations are properly parenthesized according to the rules:
1. All binary operations are properly parenthesized
2. No if statements are used, so no need for compound statements
3. No character operations are used
4. All types are appropriate

Wait, the rules say to use fixed-width integer types, but we're using double which is a floating point type, which should be fine.

Since the implementation seems correct, perhaps the errors are elsewhere. Let's make sure all operations are properly implemented:

Wait, the exp() function should be a free function according to the instructions, but it's a member function in the implementation. The instructions say to implement "exponent of a given complex number", which could be interpreted as a member function or a free function.

But the interface shows it as a member function, so it should be fine.

Since I can't see the actual errors, I'll make sure the implementation is robust:
1. Handle division by zero
2. Ensure all operations are precise

Wait, division by a complex number where both real and imaginary parts are zero would cause division by zero. Let's add a check:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    // (a + bi) / (c + di) = [(a*c + b*d)/(c^2 + d^2)] + [(b*c - a*d)/(c^2 + d^2)]i
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
=======
Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    // Check for division by zero
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    if (denominator == 0.0) {
        // Handle division by zero - perhaps throw an exception or return NaN
        // Since the behavior isn't specified, we'll return NaN
        return Complex(std::numeric_limits<double>::quiet_NaN(), std::numeric_limits<double>::quiet_NaN());
    }
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

But we need to include <limits> for std::numeric_limits:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "complex_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>
=======
#include "complex_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>
#include <limits>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This handles division by zero cases. Let's also make sure all operations are properly parenthesized according to the rules:

Wait, all operations seem to be properly parenthesized:
1. All binary operations have their operands clearly defined
2. No mixed precedence issues

Since the implementation seems correct, and the only potential issue was division by zero, this should address any errors. Let's proceed with these changes.

#### Fix the code in complex_numbers.h complex_numbers.cpp to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests are trying to perform operations between complex numbers and real numbers (doubles), but our implementation only supports operations between complex numbers. We need to add overloads to handle these cases.

Since we can't change the test cases, we need to implement operators that can handle:
1. Complex + double
2. double + Complex
3. Complex - double
4. double - Complex
5. Complex * double
6. double * Complex
7. Complex / double
8. double / Complex

Let's add these as non-member friend functions to allow conversions on both sides of the operator.

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
};
=======
class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    
    // Member operators
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Friend operators to handle operations with doubles
    friend Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these friend functions in the source file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    // Check for division by zero
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    if (denominator == 0.0) {
        // Handle division by zero - perhaps throw an exception or return NaN
        // Since the behavior isn't specified, we'll return NaN
        return Complex(std::numeric_limits<double>::quiet_NaN(), std::numeric_limits<double>::quiet_NaN());
    }
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
=======
Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    // Check for division by zero
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    if (denominator == 0.0) {
        // Handle division by zero - perhaps throw an exception or return NaN
        // Since the behavior isn't specified, we'll return NaN
        return Complex(std::numeric_limits<double>::quiet_NaN(), std::numeric_limits<double>::quiet_NaN());
    }
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

// Implement friend operators
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real_ + rhs, lhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs + rhs.real_, rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real_ - rhs, lhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs - rhs.real_, -rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real_ * rhs, lhs.imag_ * rhs);
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs * rhs.real_, lhs * rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real_ / rhs, lhs.imag_ / rhs);
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To divide a real number by a complex number, we can treat the real number as a complex number with imaginary part 0
    // So it's (lhs + 0i) / (rhs.real_ + rhs.imag_i)
    Complex temp(lhs, 0.0);
    return temp / rhs;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should now handle all the cases where doubles are used with complex numbers in operations:
1. Adding a double to a complex number treats the double as a complex number with zero imaginary part
2. Subtracting follows the same pattern
3. Multiplying scales both real and imaginary parts by the double
4. Division is a bit more involved, especially when dividing a double by a complex number, which uses the existing complex division implementation

This should now pass all the test cases that were failing. Let's hope this resolves the issues.

I understand. The implementation needs to be within the `complex_numbers` namespace. Since the friend functions are declared within the class, they're in the same namespace, but their definitions need to be explicitly in the namespace.

However, the friend functions are being defined outside the namespace, which is causing issues. Let's fix that by qualifying them with the namespace.

Wait, the implementation is already within the `complex_numbers` namespace, so that's correct. Let's see:

Actually, the implementation looks correct. But perhaps the issue is that the friend functions need to be declared and defined properly. Let's make sure all operators are properly defined within the namespace.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Let's check if there are any other issues:
1. All operators are implemented
2. All are within the correct namespace
3. The implementation matches the declarations

Since the implementation looks correct, perhaps the errors are elsewhere. Let's make sure all operators are properly implemented to handle the test cases.

Wait, the implementation of `operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs)` might be causing issues because it's calling `temp / rhs`, which uses the member operator/ which might not be found. Let's fix that by implementing it directly:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To divide a real number by a complex number, we can treat the real number as a complex number with imaginary part 0
    // So it's (lhs + 0i) / (rhs.real_ + rhs.imag_i)
    Complex temp(lhs, 0.0);
    return temp / rhs;
}
=======
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // Implement directly using the formula for (a + 0i)/(c + di) = (a*c)/(c^2 + d^2) + (-a*d)/(c^2 + d^2)i
    double denominator = (rhs.real_ * rhs.real_) + (rhs.imag_ * rhs.imag_);
    if (denominator == 0.0) {
        return Complex(std::numeric_limits<double>::quiet_NaN(), std::numeric_limits<double>::quiet_NaN());
    }
    double real_part = (lhs * rhs.real_) / denominator;
    double imag_part = (-lhs * rhs.imag_) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This should now properly handle division of a double by a complex number without relying on other operators that might not be found.

This implementation follows the mathematical formula directly:
(a + 0i) / (c + di) = (a*c)/(c² + d²) + (-a*d)/(c² + d²)i

This should now work correctly. Let's hope this resolves any remaining issues.
