#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.  
####   
#### In the end, you should be able to:  
####   
#### - Add a student's name to the roster for a grade  
####   - "Add Jim to grade 2."  
####   - "OK."  
#### - Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade  
####   - "Which students are in grade 2?"  
####   - "We've only got Jim just now."  
#### - Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  
####   Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.  
####   - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"  
####   - "Let me think.  
####     We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.  
####     So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"  
####   
#### Note that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.  
#### In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grade_school.cpp grade_school.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. We need to implement a school roster system that can add students to grades and retrieve them in a sorted manner. Let's think through this carefully.

Since we need to store students per grade, and grades are numbers, we can use a map where the key is the grade number and the value is a list of student names. We need to ensure:
1. When adding a student, they're not already present in any grade
2. The lists are always sorted alphabetically
3. The roster can be retrieved with grades in order and students sorted within each grade

However, the note says that each student can only be added once to the entire roster, not just per grade. So we need to track all students to prevent duplicates.

Wait, the instructions say "each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster", which suggests they can't be in multiple grades either.

Let's implement this using a map from grade to a set of names (to ensure uniqueness per grade) and also track all students to ensure no duplicates across grades.

Wait, but the note says "each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster", which could mean:
1. They can't be in the same grade more than once
2. They can't be in the roster (any grade) more than once

Since it says "or", it's probably both. So we need to check if the student exists in any grade before adding.

Now, let's implement the interface:

First, we need to add function declarations to the header file, and then implement them in the cpp file.

Here are the necessary changes:

grade_school.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(GRADE_SCHOOL_H)
#define GRADE_SCHOOL_H

namespace grade_school {

}  // namespace grade_school

#endif // GRADE_SCHOOL_H
=======
#if !defined(GRADE_SCHOOL_H)
#define GRADE_SCHOOL_H

#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

namespace grade_school {

class school {
private:
    std::map<int, std::vector<std::string>> roster_;
public:
    // Add a student to a grade
    void add(const std::string& name, int grade);
    
    // Get all students in a grade, sorted alphabetically
    std::vector<std::string> grade(int grade_num) const;
    
    // Get the complete school roster, sorted by grade and then by name
    std::map<int, std::vector<std::string>> roster() const;
};

}  // namespace grade_school

#endif // GRADE_SCHOOL_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation in grade_school.cpp:

grade_school.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "grade_school.h"

namespace grade_school {

}  // namespace grade_school
=======
#include "grade_school.h"
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace grade_school {

void school::add(const std::string& name, int grade) {
    // Check if the student is already in any grade
    for (const auto& entry : roster_) {
        const auto& students = entry.second;
        if (std::find(students.begin(), students.end(), name) != students.end()) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Student already exists in the roster");
        }
    }
    
    // Add to the appropriate grade
    roster_[grade].push_back(name);
    // Sort the students in the grade alphabetically
    std::sort(roster_[grade].begin(), roster_[grade].end());
}

std::vector<std::string> school::grade(int grade_num) const {
    auto it = roster_.find(grade_num);
    if (it != roster_.end()) {
        return it->second;
    }
    return {};
}

std::map<int, std::vector<std::string>> school::roster() const {
    return roster_;
}

}  // namespace grade_school
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The implementation needs to ensure that when a student is added, they're not in any grade
2. The roster() method returns a copy, which is fine
3. The grade() method returns a copy of the list, which ensures the internal data isn't modified

This implementation should work, but let's test the logic:
1. When adding a student, we check all grades to see if the name exists
2. If found, throw an exception
3. Otherwise, add to the specified grade and sort

However, this could be optimized by maintaining a separate set of all student names to check for duplicates in O(1) time, but since the instructions don't specify performance requirements, this implementation should be fine.

Wait, the note says "your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect" when trying to add the same student more than once. Throwing an exception is a good way to do that.

This implementation should meet all the requirements:
1. Add students to grades
2. Get students per grade (always sorted)
3. Get all students across all grades, sorted by grade number and within each grade by name
4. Prevent adding the same student multiple times

However, the roster() method returns a map which is ordered by its keys (grades), which are integers, so they'll be in numerical order, which meets the requirement.

I understand. The issue is that we need to use fixed-width integer types instead of `int`. Let's fix that by including `<cstdint>` and using `std::int32_t` consistently.

Here are the necessary changes:

}

std::map<std::int32_t, std::vector<std::string>> school::roster() const {

}

```

These changes ensure that:
1. All integer types are now fixed-width types (std::int32_t)
2. We include the necessary header <cstdint>
3. The function signatures match between the header and implementation files
4. The implementation remains the same, just with the correct types

This should now comply with the MISRA C++ rules provided, which require using fixed-width integer types instead of basic integer types like 'int'.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to ensure that when we add a student, we don't throw an exception but instead just don't add them if they're already present. However, the instructions say "your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect", which could mean different things. Since the tests may expect a certain behavior, and throwing an exception may not be what they expect, we need to be careful.

But the instructions don't specify how to indicate it's incorrect. Since this is likely part of a test suite, and the tests may expect that adding a duplicate student is simply ignored, let's modify the implementation to not add the student if they already exist in any grade.

Wait, the note says "when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect". This could mean:
1. Throw an exception
2. Return a status value
3. Do nothing (and the test framework detects this)

Since the function signature is `void add(...)`, we can't return a status. So either throw or do nothing. Let's assume we should do nothing and not add the student.

Here's the fix:

grade_school.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "grade_school.h"
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cstdint>

namespace grade_school {

void school::add(const std::string& name, std::int32_t grade) {
    // Check if the student is already in any grade
    for (const auto& entry : roster_) {
        const auto& students = entry.second;
        if (std::find(students.begin(), students.end(), name) != students.end()) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Student already exists in the roster");
        }
    }
    
    // Add to the appropriate grade
    roster_[grade].push_back(name);
    // Sort the students in the grade alphabetically
    std::sort(roster_[grade].begin(), roster_[grade].end());
}

std::vector<std::string> school::grade(std::int32_t grade_num) const {
    auto it = roster_.find(grade_num);
    if (it != roster_.end()) {
        return it->second;
    }
    return {};
}

    return roster_;
}

        if (std::find(students.begin(), students.end(), name) != students.end()) {
            // Student already exists, don't add
            return;
        }
    }
    
    // Add to the appropriate grade
    roster_[grade].push_back(name);
    // Sort the students in the grade alphabetically
    std::sort(roster_[grade].begin(), roster_[grade].end());
}

std::vector<std::string> school::grade(std::int32_t grade_num) const {
    auto it = roster_.find(grade_num);

    return {};

```

This implementation now simply returns if the student is found in any grade, which indicates that adding a duplicate student is incorrect by not modifying the roster. This should satisfy the requirement to "indicate that this is incorrect" by not allowing the addition to proceed.

However, the note says "each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster", which suggests that the same student can't be in different grades either. Our implementation checks across all grades, which is correct.

This implementation should now work with the test cases:
1. Adding a student to a grade
2. Getting students per grade (always sorted)
3. Getting the complete roster (sorted by grade and within grade by name)
4. Preventing adding the same student multiple times by ignoring subsequent additions

Let's hope this satisfies the requirements. If there are further issues, we may need to adjust based on specific test expectations.
