#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a fancy store.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value and weight.  
#### Bob would gladly take all of the items, but his knapsack can only hold so much weight.  
#### Bob has to carefully consider which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to determine which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized, taking into account the knapsack's carrying capacity.  
####   
#### Items will be represented as a list of items.  
#### Each item will have a weight and value.  
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10  
#### ```  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.h knapsack.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a solution to the classic 0/1 knapsack problem. Since Bob can only take one of each item, and we need to maximize the total value without exceeding the maximum weight, we can use dynamic programming.

Since the maximum weight can be up to a large number, and the number of items can be large, we need an efficient approach. Let's use a dynamic programming approach where dp[i] represents the maximum value achievable with weight i.

However, to be efficient, we'll process each item and update our dp array accordingly.

Wait, the maximum weight can be up to 2000 according to some online sources, but the problem doesn't specify. Let's assume it can be up to a reasonable number.

Since all values are positive, we can initialize our dp array with 0, and for each item, we can update from the maximum weight down to the item's weight.

Now, let's implement this solution.

First, we need to add a function to the namespace that solves the knapsack problem. Let's add a function declaration to the header file.

Here are the necessary changes:

knapsack.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    int weight;
    int value;
};

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
=======
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    std::int32_t weight;
    std::int32_t value;
};

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items);

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the function in the cpp file:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"

namespace knapsack
{

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty())
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i] is the maximum value with weight i
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, we process from the end
        for (std::int32_t i = maximum_weight; i >= item.weight; --i)
        {
            if (dp[i] < (dp[i - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[i] = dp[i - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    // Since dp[i] is always non-decreasing, the last element is the maximum
    // But to be safe, we'll find the maximum
    std::int32_t max_value = 0;
    for (std::int32_t i = 0; i <= maximum_weight; ++i)
    {
        if (dp[i] > max_value)
        {
            max_value = dp[i];
        }
    }
    return max_value;
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation uses dynamic programming where dp[i] represents the maximum value that can be achieved with weight i. For each item, we update the dp array from the maximum weight down to the item's weight to ensure we don't use the same item multiple times.

However, there are a few things to note:
1. All values are positive, so initializing with 0 is fine
2. We process items one by one, and for each weight, we decide whether to include the current item or not
3. The time complexity is O(n * W) where n is the number of items and W is the maximum weight
4. The space complexity is O(W)

This should work within the constraints. Let's test it with the provided example:
Items: [
  { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },
  { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }
]
Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10

Processing:
- For item 1 (5, 10): Update weights 10 down to 5
- For item 2 (4, 40): Update weights 10 down to 4
- For item 3 (6, 30): Update weights 10 down to 6
- For item 4 (4, 50): Update weights 10 down to 4

The maximum value should be 90 (items 2 and 4: weight 4 + 4 = 8 <= 10, value 40 + 50 = 90)

This implementation should correctly compute that.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle cases where the maximum weight is 0, and to ensure all operations are correct according to the MISRA C++ rules. Let's fix the implementation.

However, the implementation looks correct, but there might be issues with integer types. Let's make sure all types are consistent and follow the rules.

Wait, the maximum_value function needs to be implemented, and it's not present in the provided knapsack.cpp. Let's add it.

Actually, the implementation is there, but let's make sure it's correct. The implementation uses std::int32_t which matches the declaration.

However, there's a potential issue when maximum_weight is 0. Let's test:
- If maximum_weight is 0, then no items can be selected, so the maximum value is 0
- The current implementation handles this correctly by checking if items.empty() first, but if maximum_weight is 0, we need to return 0 immediately

Wait, the implementation may not handle maximum_weight == 0 correctly because it creates a vector of size maximum_weight + 1 which would be size 1, and then processes items. But items with weight > 0 won't be added, which is correct.

But to be safe, let's add an early return if maximum_weight is 0.

Here are the necessary fixes:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty())
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i] is the maximum value with weight i
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, we process from the end
        for (std::int32_t i = maximum_weight; i >= item.weight; --i)
        {
            if (dp[i] < (dp[i - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[i] = dp[i - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    // Since dp[i] is always non-decreasing, the last element is the maximum
    // But to be safe, we'll find the maximum
    std::int32_t max_value = 0;
    for (std::int32_t i = 0; i <= maximum_weight; ++i)
    {
        if (dp[i] > max_value)
        {
            max_value = dp[i];
        }
    }
    return max_value;
}

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    // Handle cases where maximum weight is 0 or no items
    if ((maximum_weight == 0) || (items.empty()))
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i] is the maximum value with weight i
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(static_cast<std::size_t>(maximum_weight) + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, we process from the end
        // Ensure we use the same type for the loop counter
        for (std::int32_t i = maximum_weight; i >= item.weight; --i)
        {
            // Ensure we don't access out of bounds
            // The remaining weight is always non-negative because i >= item.weight
            std::int32_t remaining_weight = i - item.weight;
            std::int32_t new_value = dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(remaining_weight)] + item.value;
            if (dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(i)] < new_value)
            {
                dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(i)] = new_value;

    {
        if (dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(i)] > max_value)
        {

```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. Added explicit handling for maximum_weight == 0
2. Added explicit casts to std::size_t when indexing into the vector to avoid potential warnings
3. Broke down expressions to make them clearer and follow parentheses rules
4. All types are consistent (std::int32_t)

This implementation should now follow the MISRA C++ rules:
1. Using fixed-width integer types
2. No mixing of types in assignments
3. Using parentheses to make operator precedence clear

However, there's one potential issue: when maximum_weight is negative, but according to the problem, the maximum weight should be non-negative, so we don't need to handle that case.

Let's test our implementation with the provided example:
Items: [
  { weight: 5, value: 10 },
  { weight: 4, value: 40 },
  { weight: 6, value: 30 },
  { weight: 4, value: 50 }
]
Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10

The implementation should correctly compute the maximum value of 90.
