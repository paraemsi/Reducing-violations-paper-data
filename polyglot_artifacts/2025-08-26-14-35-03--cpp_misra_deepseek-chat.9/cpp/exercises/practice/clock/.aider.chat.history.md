#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a clock that handles times without dates.  
####   
#### You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.  
####   
#### Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.h clock.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a clock class that can handle time operations without dates, including adding and subtracting minutes, and ensuring that two clocks representing the same time are considered equal.

Since we're working in C++, we'll need to create a Clock class that can:
1. Store hours and minutes
2. Handle wrapping around when minutes exceed 60 or go below 0
3. Handle hours wrapping around when they exceed 24 or go below 0
4. Provide equality comparison
5. Support adding and subtracting minutes

However, the provided files are empty, so we need to define the Clock class and its implementation.

Let's start by defining the Clock class in the header file:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
=======
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

namespace date_independent {

class clock {
private:
    std::int32_t minutes;
    explicit clock(std::int32_t total_minutes);
    
public:
    static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
    clock plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const;
    clock minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const;
    operator std::string() const;
    bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
    bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;
};

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the Clock class in the cpp file:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {

clock::clock(std::int32_t total_minutes) {
    // Normalize to be within 0-1439 minutes (24 hours)
    total_minutes %= 1440;
    if (total_minutes < 0) {
        total_minutes += 1440;
    }
    minutes = total_minutes;
}

clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
    return clock(total_minutes);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const {
    return clock(minutes + minutes_to_add);
}

clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const {
    return clock(minutes - minutes_to_subtract);
}

clock::operator std::string() const {
    std::int32_t hrs = minutes / 60;
    std::int32_t mins = minutes % 60;
    
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << std::setfill('0') << std::setw(2) << hrs << ":"
        << std::setfill('0') << std::setw(2) << mins;
    return oss.str();
}

bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
    return minutes == other.minutes;
}

bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
    return minutes != other.minutes;
}

}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The implementation normalizes the total minutes to always be within 0-1439 (which represents 24 hours)
2. When adding or subtracting minutes, it may wrap around, which is handled by the constructor
3. The string conversion uses hours and minutes derived from the total minutes
4. We use std::setw and std::setfill to ensure two-digit formatting
5. The implementation follows the MISRA C++ rules by using std::int32_t

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
1. Handle adding and subtracting minutes
2. Two clocks with the same time are equal (operator==)
3. Times wrap around correctly when they exceed 24 hours or go below 0
4. Uses fixed-width integer types as per the rules

However, the implementation uses a private constructor, which is fine, and provides a static factory method `at()` to create clock instances. The `plus()` and `minus()` methods return new clock instances, which is appropriate for immutable value types.

This implementation should work, but let me know if there are any issues or additional requirements.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle the normalization correctly and to ensure all operations work as expected. Let's fix the implementation.

The key is to always normalize the time to be within 0-1439 minutes (24 hours). However, when adding or subtracting, we need to handle negative values properly.

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but perhaps there are issues with the normalization. Let's make sure:
1. The total minutes are always positive and within 0-1439
2. The hours and minutes are always valid

However, the implementation uses modulo which can give negative results, which we then adjust. This seems correct.

Wait, the implementation in the constructor seems correct:
total_minutes %= 1440;
if (total_minutes < 0) total_minutes += 1440;

This ensures the value is always between 0 and 1439.

But perhaps there are issues with large values when adding or subtracting. Let's test:
Adding a large number of minutes should wrap around correctly.

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but let's make sure all operations are precise.

Actually, the implementation looks correct, but perhaps the issue is with the parameters being signed integers. According to the rules, we need to be careful about assignments and operations.

Wait, the instructions say to use fixed-width types, which we are doing. But perhaps the implementation needs to be more precise.

Let's fix the implementation to be more robust:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {

clock::clock(std::int32_t total_minutes) {
    // Normalize to be within 0-1439 minutes (24 hours)
    total_minutes %= 1440;
    if (total_minutes < 0) {
        total_minutes += 1440;
    }
    minutes = total_minutes;
}

clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
    return clock(total_minutes);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const {
    return clock(minutes + minutes_to_add);
}

clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const {
    return clock(minutes - minutes_to_subtract);
}

clock::operator std::string() const {
    std::int32_t hrs = minutes / 60;
    std::int32_t mins = minutes % 60;
    
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << std::setfill('0') << std::setw(2) << hrs << ":"
        << std::setfill('0') << std::setw(2) << mins;
    return oss.str();
}

bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
    return minutes == other.minutes;
}

bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
    return minutes != other.minutes;
}

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {

clock::clock(std::int32_t total_minutes) {
    // Normalize to be within 0-1439 minutes (24 hours)
    // Handle negative values by adding enough days to make it positive
    std::int32_t normalized_minutes = total_minutes % 1440;
    if (normalized_minutes < 0) {
        normalized_minutes += 1440;
    }
    minutes = normalized_minutes;
}

clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes_val) {
    // Convert hours to minutes and add minutes_val
    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes_val;
    return clock(total_minutes);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const {
    return clock(minutes + minutes_to_add);
}

clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const {
    return clock(minutes - minutes_to_subtract);
}

clock::operator std::string() const {
    std::int32_t hrs = minutes / 60;
    std::int32_t mins = minutes % 60;
    
    // Ensure hours are within 0-23 by taking modulo 24
    // But since minutes are always between 0-1439, hrs will be between 0-23
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << std::setfill('0') << std::setw(2) << hrs << ":"
        << std::setfill('0') << std::setw(2) << mins;
    return oss.str();
}

bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
    return minutes == other.minutes;
}

bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
    return minutes != other.minutes;
}

}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue: the parameter name `minutes` in `at()` conflicts with the member variable `minutes`. Let's rename it to `minutes_val` to avoid confusion.

Wait, the implementation uses `minutes_val` which is better. This should prevent any naming conflicts.

Also, the implementation ensures that the total minutes are always normalized to be within 0-1439, which represents valid times from 00:00 to 23:59.

This implementation should now handle:
1. Adding and subtracting minutes correctly, including wrapping around days
2. Equality comparison based on the normalized time
3. Proper string formatting with leading zeros
4. All operations using fixed-width integer types as per the rules

Let's also make sure that the header file uses consistent parameter names:

Wait, the header file uses `minutes` which could conflict with the member variable. Let's fix that:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
    clock plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const;
    clock minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const;
=======
    static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes_val);
    clock plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const;
    clock minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the parameter name in the declaration matches the implementation, and avoids potential naming conflicts with the member variable `minutes`.

These changes should now make the implementation correct and follow the MISRA C++ rules:
1. Using fixed-width integer types
2. No naming conflicts
3. Proper handling of time operations
4. Appropriate parenthesization in expressions (though not explicitly shown here, the expressions are simple enough)
5. No mixed category assignments or narrowing conversions

This implementation should now work as expected for the clock operations.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle the normalization correctly. Let's fix the implementation to ensure it always produces valid times.

The key is to always normalize the total minutes to be within 0-1439 (which represents 24 hours). However, when the total minutes are negative, we need to add enough days to make them positive.

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but perhaps there are issues with very large numbers that could cause integer overflow. But since we're using std::int32_t, and the maximum number of minutes in about 2 years is around 1,051,200 which fits within ±2,147,483,647, it should be fine.

However, to be precise, let's make sure the normalization always works correctly:

Wait, the implementation uses modulo which can be negative, which we then adjust. This is correct.

But perhaps the issue is with the parameters to `at()`. The hours and minutes_val could be negative, which needs to be handled properly. Let's fix that:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes_val) {
    // Convert hours to minutes and add minutes_val
    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes_val;
    return clock(total_minutes);
}
=======
clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes_val) {
    // Convert everything to total minutes first, then normalize
    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes_val;
    // Normalize to be within 0-1439 minutes (24 hours)
    // Handle negative values by adding enough days to make it positive
    std::int32_t normalized_minutes = total_minutes % 1440;
    if (normalized_minutes < 0) {
        normalized_minutes += 1440;
    }
    return clock(normalized_minutes);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Wait, but the clock constructor already does this normalization, so this is redundant. But perhaps it's better to be explicit.

Actually, the clock constructor already handles normalization, so we can just pass total_minutes directly:
return clock(total_minutes);

But if total_minutes is very large, the modulo operation in the constructor will handle it correctly.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Maybe the issue is elsewhere.

Perhaps the issue is with the string conversion. Let's make sure hours are always between 0 and 23:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
clock::operator std::string() const {
    std::int32_t hrs = minutes / 60;
    std::int32_t mins = minutes % 60;
    
    // Ensure hours are within 0-23 by taking modulo 24
    // But since minutes are always between 0-1439, hrs will be between 0-23
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << std::setfill('0') << std::setw(2) << hrs << ":"
        << std::setfill('0') << std::setw(2) << mins;
    return oss.str();
}
=======
clock::operator std::string() const {
    // Since minutes is always between 0-1439, hours will be between 0-23
    std::int32_t hrs = minutes / 60;
    std::int32_t mins = minutes % 60;
    // Make sure to take modulo 24 for hours to handle cases where hrs could be 24
    // But since minutes is always < 1440, hrs will always be < 24
    hrs %= 24;
    
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << std::setfill('0') << std::setw(2) << hrs << ":"
        << std::setfill('0') << std::setw(2) << mins;
    return oss.str();
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

But since minutes is always between 0 and 1439, hrs will always be between 0 and 23, so the modulo operation is redundant. But it's better to be safe.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Perhaps the issue is with the tests expecting specific behavior.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Let's make sure all operations are precise and follow the rules:

1. Always use parentheses to make precedence clear
2. No mixed-type operations
3. All assignments are appropriate

Wait, the implementation seems to follow these rules. Let's add parentheses to make sure:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes_val;
=======
    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes_val;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This is already parenthesized correctly.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the clock class needs to be named 'clock' but the namespace might conflict? No, it's in the date_independent namespace.

Actually, everything seems correct. Let's run through a test case:
1. clock::at(8, 0) -> "08:00"
2. clock::at(11, 9) -> "11:09"
3. Adding 3 minutes to "11:09" -> "11:12"
4. Subtracting 10 minutes from "11:09" -> "11:59" (wait, no: 11*60 +9 = 669 -10 = 659 -> 10:59)

Wait, 669 - 10 = 659 minutes
659 / 60 = 10 hours
659 % 60 = 59 minutes
So "10:59" which matches

This seems correct.

Perhaps the implementation is correct, and the error is elsewhere. Let's make sure all functions are implemented as expected.

Since the implementation seems correct, and the error messages aren't specific, I'll assume the implementation is fine. If there are specific errors, please provide them.
