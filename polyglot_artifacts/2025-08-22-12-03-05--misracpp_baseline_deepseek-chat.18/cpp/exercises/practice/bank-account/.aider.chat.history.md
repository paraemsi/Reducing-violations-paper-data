#### # Introduction  
####   
#### After years of filling out forms and waiting, you've finally acquired your banking license.  
#### This means you are now officially eligible to open your own bank, hurray!  
####   
#### Your first priority is to get the IT systems up and running.  
#### After a day of hard work, you can already open and close accounts, as well as handle withdrawals and deposits.  
####   
#### Since you couldn't be bothered writing tests, you invite some friends to help test the system.  
#### However, after just five minutes, one of your friends claims they've lost money!  
#### While you're confident your code is bug-free, you start looking through the logs to investigate.  
####   
#### Ah yes, just as you suspected, your friend is at fault!  
#### They shared their test credentials with another friend, and together they conspired to make deposits and withdrawals from the same account _in parallel_.  
#### Who would do such a thing?  
####   
#### While you argue that it's physically _impossible_ for someone to access their account in parallel, your friend smugly notifies you that the banking rules _require_ you to support this.  
#### Thus, no parallel banking support, no go-live signal.  
#### Sighing, you create a mental note to work on this tomorrow.  
#### This will set your launch date back at _least_ one more day, but well...  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
####   
#### As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), your bank software must allow accounts to be safely accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.  
#### For example, there may be many deposits and withdrawals occurring in parallel; you need to ensure there are no [race conditions][wikipedia] between when you read the account balance and set the new balance.  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
####   
#### [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.cpp bank_account.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I understand. We need to implement a thread-safe bank account system that supports deposits, withdrawals, and account status (open/closed). Since multiple threads can access the account simultaneously, we need to use synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

Since this is C++, we can use mutexes from the standard library to ensure thread safety. Let's implement the necessary functionality:

1. Track the account balance
2. Track whether the account is open or closed
3. Make all operations thread-safe using a mutex
4. Ensure operations on a closed account fail

However, the provided class is empty, so we need to add all the necessary member functions:
- Constructor/Destructor
- open(), close()
- deposit(), withdraw()
- balance()

Let's implement this:

Here are the necessary changes:

bank_account.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
=======
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <mutex>

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {
private:
    int balance_;
    bool is_open_;
    mutable std::mutex mutex_;
    
public:
    Bankaccount();
    void open();
    void close();
    int balance() const;
    void deposit(int amount);
    void withdraw(int amount);
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these methods in the .cpp file:

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "bank_account.h"

namespace Bankaccount {}
=======
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : balance_(0), is_open_(false) {}

void Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is already open");
    }
    is_open_ = true;
    balance_ = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is not open");
    }
    is_open_ = false;
}

int Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    return balance_;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(int amount) {
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    balance_ += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(int amount) {
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount > balance_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    balance_ -= amount;
}

}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to include the <stdexcept> header for exceptions
2. All operations are synchronized using a mutex to prevent race conditions
3. We check if the account is open before performing operations
4. We validate input amounts to ensure they're positive
5. For withdrawals, we also check if there are sufficient funds

This implementation ensures that:
1. Multiple threads can safely access the account without race conditions
2. Operations on a closed account will throw exceptions
3. Deposits and withdrawals are atomic operations
4. The balance is always consistent

However, the exact error messages may need to match what the tests expect. If the tests fail due to specific error messages, we may need to adjust them. But for now, this implementation should meet the requirements.

I understand. The implementation needs to be thread-safe, but there are some issues to address. The main concern is that the `balance()` function is marked as `const`, which means it shouldn't modify the object. However, locking a mutex modifies its internal state, which violates `const`-correctness. That's why we need to make the mutex `mutable`.

Wait, the implementation already does that, which is correct. So what's the issue?

Perhaps the tests are expecting different behavior. Let me think about the requirements:
1. Initially, the account is closed
2. Operations on a closed account must fail
3. We need to support parallel access

But the implementation seems correct. Maybe the error messages need to be more specific? Or perhaps we need to handle certain cases differently.

Wait, the instructions say:
"operations against a closed account must fail"
But it doesn't specify how they should fail. Throwing exceptions seems appropriate.

However, the implementation looks correct. Let's see if there are any issues:
1. The mutex is mutable, which allows locking in const member functions
2. All operations are properly synchronized
3. Account state is checked before operations

Perhaps the issue is that the implementation doesn't match what the tests expect. Let's make sure:
1. When opening, if the account is already open, throw an exception
2. When closing, if the account is not open, throw an exception
3. When accessing balance, if the account is closed, throw an exception
4. When depositing or withdrawing, if the account is closed, throw an exception

This matches our implementation.

Wait, the implementation may need to reset the balance when opening, which it does by setting it to 0.
But what if the account was previously open, closed, and then opened again? The implementation always sets balance to 0 when opening, which seems correct.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the tests are failing for other reasons.

Perhaps the tests expect the account to be open upon construction? But the instructions don't say that.
The implementation has is_open_ set to false initially, which matches the requirement that operations on a closed account must fail.

Wait, the implementation always sets balance to 0 when opening, which is correct.

Let's make sure all operations are properly synchronized:
1. All member functions that access shared data (balance_ and is_open_) are protected by the mutex
2. The mutex is locked before accessing these members
3. The mutex is automatically unlocked when the lock_guard goes out of scope

This seems correct.

Perhaps the issue is that the implementation needs to be in a specific way that matches the tests.
Since we don't have the tests, we need to be careful.

Wait, the user provided the files, and they seem to have added the mutex and other members.
Maybe the tests are not passing because of implementation details.

Let's make sure we're using the right headers and that everything is correct.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Let's run with it.

Since the user provided the files, and they match what we would expect, perhaps there are no errors.
But the user marked lines with █, which might indicate issues.

Wait, the marked lines are:
Line 11: mutable std::mutex mutex_;
Line 17: int balance() const;

These are correct for a thread-safe implementation where balance() is const and needs to lock the mutex.

Perhaps the user is concerned about the use of mutable, but it's necessary here.

Since the implementation seems correct, and the user asked to fix errors if possible, but didn't specify what errors, I'll assume the implementation is correct.

If there are specific test failures, we may need to adjust, but for now, the implementation looks good.
