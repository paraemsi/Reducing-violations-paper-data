#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.  
####   
#### A circular buffer first starts empty and of some predefined length.  
#### For example, this is a 7-element buffer:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Assume that a 1 is written into the middle of the buffer (exact starting location does not matter in a circular buffer):  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][1][ ][ ][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then assume that two more elements are added — 2 & 3 — which get appended after the 1:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][1][2][3][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### If two elements are then removed from the buffer, the oldest values inside the buffer are removed.  
#### The two elements removed, in this case, are 1 & 2, leaving the buffer with just a 3:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][3][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### If the buffer has 7 elements then it is completely full:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [5][6][7][8][9][3][4]  
#### ```  
####   
#### When the buffer is full an error will be raised, alerting the client that further writes are blocked until a slot becomes free.  
####   
#### When the buffer is full, the client can opt to overwrite the oldest data with a forced write.  
#### In this case, two more elements — A & B — are added and they overwrite the 3 & 4:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [5][6][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### 3 & 4 have been replaced by A & B making 5 now the oldest data in the buffer.  
#### Finally, if two elements are removed then what would be returned is 5 & 6 yielding the buffer:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Because there is space available, if the client again uses overwrite to store C & D then the space where 5 & 6 were stored previously will be used not the location of 7 & 8.  
#### 7 is still the oldest element and the buffer is once again full.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [C][D][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: circular_buffer.cpp circular_buffer.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####

I'll help you implement a circular buffer according to the instructions. Let's think through the implementation:

1. We need a buffer that can store elements
2. We need to track the read and write positions
3. We need to know if the buffer is full or empty
4. We need to handle overwriting old data when the buffer is full

Since this is C++, we'll make it a template class to handle different types.
Let's implement it in the header file.

However, the instructions say not to change existing function or class names, but the namespace seems empty.
So we need to define a class within the circular_buffer namespace.

Wait, the files are empty, so we need to implement everything from scratch.

Here's the plan:
1. Define a template class `circular_buffer` in the header
2. Implement its member functions in the cpp file, but since it's a template, we need to implement in the header
   Or we can include the implementation in the header
3. Let's implement everything in the header to keep it simple

Wait, the instructions say to modify both files, but templates typically need to be implemented in headers.
Maybe we can implement the member functions in the cpp file with explicit instantiations, but that's not flexible.
Since this is an exercise, let's implement everything in the header.

Here are the necessary operations:
1. Constructor to create a buffer of a given size
2. read() to remove and return the oldest element
3. write() to add an element, which may throw if the buffer is full
4. overwrite() to add an element, overwriting the oldest element if the buffer is full
5. clear() to make the buffer empty
6. We need to track read and write indices, and whether the buffer is full

Here are the implementations:

circular_buffer.h

    size_t write_pos;
    size_t count;
    size_t capacity;

public:
    explicit circular_buffer(size_t size) 
        : buffer(size), read_pos(0), write_pos(0), count(0), capacity(size) {
    }

    T read() {
        if (count == 0) {
            throw std::domain_error("Buffer is empty");
        }
        T value = buffer[read_pos];
        read_pos = (read_pos + 1) % capacity;
        --count;
        return value;
    }

    void write(const T& value) {
        if (count == capacity) {
            throw std::domain_error("Buffer is full");
        }
        buffer[write_pos] = value;
        write_pos = (write_pos + 1) % capacity;
        ++count;
    }

    void overwrite(const T& value) {
        if (count < capacity) {
            write(value);
        } else {
            buffer[write_pos] = value;
            write_pos = (write_pos + 1) % capacity;
            read_pos = (read_pos + 1) % capacity;
        }
    }

    void clear() {
        read_pos = 0;
        write_pos = 0;
        count = 0;
    }
};

}  // namespace circular_buffer

#endif // CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, the implementation needs to follow the MISRA C++ rules provided. Let's check:
1. We're using size_t which is an unsigned integer type, but the rules say to use fixed-width types
2. We need to include <cstdint> and use std::size_t or fixed-width types
3. But size_t is standard and necessary for indexing
4. Let's make sure to follow other rules

Wait, the rules say not to use standard unsigned integer types, but size_t is a standard unsigned integer type.
This seems to conflict. Maybe we need to use a fixed-width type for indices.
But the size of the buffer could be large, so we should use std::uint64_t to be safe.

Wait, the rules say to use fixed-width types, so let's use std::uint64_t for indices and counts.
Also, we need to ensure all operations follow the parentheses rules.

Let's fix that:

Wait, the implementation needs to be in the .cpp file? But it's a template, which typically needs to be in headers.
Since the instructions say to modify both files, and the tests may expect certain things, we need to be careful.

Actually, the implementation needs to be in the header to work properly with templates.
Let's proceed with the header implementation, making sure to follow the rules.

Wait, the user may want the implementation in the .cpp file, but that's not standard for templates.
Since the instructions are not clear, I'll implement in the header.

Here's the fixed implementation following the rules:

circular_buffer.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H)
#define CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H

namespace circular_buffer {

}  // namespace circular_buffer

#endif // CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H

#if !defined(CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H)
#define CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H

#include <vector>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cstdint>

namespace circular_buffer {

template <typename T>
class circular_buffer {
private:
    std::vector<T> buffer;
    std::uint64_t read_pos;
    std::uint64_t write_pos;
    std::uint64_t count;
    std::uint64_t capacity;

public:
    explicit circular_buffer(std::uint64_t size) 
        : buffer(size), read_pos(0), write_pos(0), count(0), capacity(size) {
    }

    T read() {
        if (count == 0) {
            throw std::domain_error("Buffer is empty");
        }
        T value = buffer[read_pos];
        read_pos = (read_pos + 1) % capacity;
        --count;
        return value;
    }

    void write(const T& value) {
        if (count == capacity) {
            throw std::domain_error("Buffer is full");
        }
        buffer[write_pos] = value;
        write_pos = (write_pos + 1) % capacity;
        ++count;
    }

    void overwrite(const T& value) {
        if (count < capacity) {
            write(value);
        } else {
            buffer[write_pos] = value;
            write_pos = (write_pos + 1) % capacity;
            read_pos = (read_pos + 1) % capacity;
        }
    }

    void clear() {
        read_pos = 0;
        write_pos = 0;
        count = 0;
    }
};

}  // namespace circular_buffer

#endif // CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Since the .cpp file is empty, we can leave it as is, or perhaps the tests expect something there.
But the implementation is complete in the header, so the .cpp file can remain empty.

circular_buffer.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "circular_buffer.h"

namespace circular_buffer {

}  // namespace circular_buffer
=======
#include "circular_buffer.h"

namespace circular_buffer {

}  // namespace circular_buffer
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should work according to the instructions:
1. It uses a fixed-size buffer
2. It tracks read and write positions
3. It throws when trying to read from an empty buffer or write to a full buffer
4. overwrite() always succeeds, replacing the oldest element when full
5. All indices are managed using modulo arithmetic to wrap around

This should now be ready to use. Let me know if you have any questions!

Just reply with fixed versions of the block above that failed to match.  

I understand. Let's fix the implementation to follow the MISRA C++ rules while keeping the existing structure. The main issues are:
1. Using size_t which is a standard unsigned integer type
2. Adding necessary includes
3. Ensuring proper parentheses
4. Adding braces to if statements

```

This implementation now uses std::uint64_t instead of size_t, which follows the MISRA C++ rules about not using standard unsigned integer types. I've also added the necessary include for <cstdint> and used U suffixes on integer literals to ensure they're treated as unsigned.

However, there are a few things to note:
1. All if statements now have braces around their bodies
2. All operations use parentheses appropriately
3. We're using fixed-width integer types as required
4. The implementation still maintains the same functionality

This should now comply with the provided MISRA C++ rules while implementing the circular buffer as described in the instructions.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to follow the MISRA C++ rules, particularly regarding the use of parentheses in expressions. Let's fix that:

Here are the necessary changes:

circular_buffer.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    T read() {
        if (count == 0U) {
            throw std::domain_error("Buffer is empty");
        }
        T value = buffer[read_pos];
        read_pos = (read_pos + 1U) % capacity;
        --count;
        return value;
    }

    void write(const T& value) {
        if (count == capacity) {
            throw std::domain_error("Buffer is full");
        }
        buffer[write_pos] = value;
        write_pos = (write_pos + 1U) % capacity;
        ++count;
    }

    void overwrite(const T& value) {
        if (count < capacity) {
            write(value);
        } else {
            buffer[write_pos] = value;
            write_pos = (write_pos + 1U) % capacity;
            read_pos = (read_pos + 1U) % capacity;
        }
    }
=======
    T read() {
        if (count == 0U) {
            throw std::domain_error("Buffer is empty");
        }
        T value = buffer[read_pos];
        read_pos = ((read_pos + 1U) % capacity);
        --count;
        return value;
    }

    void write(const T& value) {
        if (count == capacity) {
            throw std::domain_error("Buffer is full");
        }
        buffer[write_pos] = value;
        write_pos = ((write_pos + 1U) % capacity);
        ++count;
    }

    void overwrite(const T& value) {
        if (count < capacity) {
            write(value);
        } else {
            buffer[write_pos] = value;
            write_pos = ((write_pos + 1U) % capacity);
            read_pos = ((read_pos + 1U) % capacity);
        }
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The main changes are:
1. Added extra parentheses around the modulo operations to ensure they're properly grouped
2. This follows the rule: "Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression"

However, the implementation looks correct otherwise. Let's also make sure all if/else statements have braces, which they do:
1. All if and else bodies are enclosed in braces
2. No stray semicolons after conditionals

This implementation should now comply with the provided MISRA C++ rules while maintaining the correct functionality of the circular buffer.

Wait, the implementation already seems to follow the parentheses rules. Let's check if there are other issues:
1. All if statements have braces around their bodies
2. All arithmetic operations are properly parenthesized
3. We're using fixed-width integer types

Perhaps the issue is that the implementation needs to be in the .cpp file, but since it's a template, it needs to be in the header.
Since the user provided both files, and the .cpp file is empty, maybe they want the implementation there, but that's not possible with templates.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the issue is that the class name needs to match exactly what the tests expect.
The instructions say not to change existing function or class names, but the class name is 'circular_buffer' which matches the namespace.

Perhaps the tests expect a non-template implementation? But the instructions don't specify the type.

Since the implementation looks correct and follows the rules, I think it's fine.
Let's make sure all operations are properly parenthesized according to the rules:

Wait, the rules say:
"Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression"
So expressions like (a + b) % c need to be parenthesized, which they are.

Perhaps the implementation is correct, and the markers are just pointing out lines to review.
Since no specific errors are mentioned, I'll assume the implementation is correct.

If there are specific compilation errors, please share them, and I can help fix them.
