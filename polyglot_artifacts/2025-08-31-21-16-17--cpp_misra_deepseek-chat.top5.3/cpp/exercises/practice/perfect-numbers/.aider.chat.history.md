#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of [perfect](#perfect), [abundant](#abundant), or [deficient](#deficient) based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The _aliquot sum_ is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of `15` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.  
####   
#### ## Perfect  
####   
#### A number is perfect when it equals its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `6` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`  
#### - `28` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`  
####   
#### ## Abundant  
####   
#### A number is abundant when it is less than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `12` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
#### - `24` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36`  
####   
#### ## Deficient  
####   
#### A number is deficient when it is greater than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `8` is a deficient number because `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`  
#### - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is [perfect](#perfect).  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is [abundant](#abundant) or [deficient](#deficient).

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: perfect_numbers.h perfect_numbers.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. We need to implement a classification for numbers based on their aliquot sum. Let's implement this functionality while following the provided rules.

Since we need to include fixed-width integer types, we'll include <cstdint>. We'll also need to include <cmath> for potential mathematical operations, but actually, we just need to find factors which can be done with integer operations.

However, the instructions don't specify the exact function signatures, but since this is a C++ exercise, we'll need to implement functions to classify numbers. Let's assume we need a function that takes a number and returns its classification.

Since the files provided are nearly empty, we need to define the interface in the header and implementation in the cpp file.

Let's define an enumeration for the classification types and a function to classify numbers.

Here are the necessary changes:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int64_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the classify function in perfect_numbers.cpp:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw "Number must be positive";
    }
    
    // Calculate the aliquot sum
    std::int64_t sum = 0;
    for (std::int64_t i = 1; i <= number / 2; i++) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    
    // Classify based on the sum
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to handle cases where number is 0 or negative, which are invalid. The instructions say positive integers, so we'll throw an exception in those cases.
2. We're using std::int64_t to handle potentially large numbers
3. We're using a loop up to number / 2 to find factors, which is efficient enough
4. We're following the classification rules precisely

This implementation should work for the given requirements. Let me know if you need any adjustments.

I notice that the implementation needs to be adjusted to follow the MISRA C++ rules provided. Let's fix the issues:

1. The throw statement throws a string literal, which is not ideal. We should throw an exception type
2. We need to include the appropriate headers
3. We need to ensure all if/else statements use compound statements
4. We need to ensure proper parentheses in expressions

Wait, the implementation looks correct, but according to the error markers, there might be issues in the header file.
However, the error markers are pointing to lines that seem fine. Maybe there are other requirements.

Actually, the implementation needs to be more efficient. For very large numbers, looping up to number/2 is too slow.
We can optimize by only going up to the square root of the number.

Wait, but we need to be careful to not include the number itself in the sum, and to include both factors when we find a divisor.

Let's implement a more efficient approach:

Wait, but according to the instructions, we need to find the aliquot sum which is the sum of proper divisors (excluding the number itself)
So for number=6: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Here's an optimized approach:
1. Loop up to the square root of the number
2. For each divisor i, add i and number/i to the sum
3. Be careful to not add the number itself
4. Also, if the number is a perfect square, we need to avoid adding the square root twice

But we need to make sure to always include 1, and exclude the number itself

Let's fix the implementation:

Wait, but we need to follow the MISRA rules:
1. All if/else need braces
2. Proper parentheses
3. No using numerical values of characters
4. Appropriate assignments

Here are the necessary fixes:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw "Number must be positive";
    }
    
    // Calculate the aliquot sum
    std::int64_t sum = 0;
    for (std::int64_t i = 1; i <= number / 2; i++) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    
    // Classify based on the sum
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    // Calculate the aliquot sum using optimized approach
    std::int64_t sum = 1; // 1 is always a divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); i++) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t complement = number / i;
            if (complement != i) {
                sum += complement;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Classify based on the sum
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We include <stdexcept> for std::domain_error
2. We handle number == 1 as a special case (its aliquot sum is 0, which is less than 1, so it's deficient)
3. We use an optimized approach to find divisors by looping up to the square root
4. We always add both the divisor and its complement when they're different
5. We start the sum at 1 because 1 is always a proper divisor (except for number == 1, which we handled separately)
6. All if/else statements use braces

This implementation should be more efficient and follow the rules. Let's test the cases:
- 6: divisors are 1, 2, 3 → sum=6 → perfect
- 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 → sum=28 → perfect
- 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → sum=16 → abundant
- 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 → sum=36 → abundant
- 8: 1, 2, 4 → sum=7 → deficient
- Primes: sum=1 → deficient

Wait, for number=1, we handle it separately because the loop wouldn't run (i starts at 2, and sqrt(1) is 1, which is less than 2)
So we return classification::deficient which matches (1 > 0)

This implementation should now be correct and efficient. Let me know if you encounter any issues.
