#### # Introduction  
####   
#### After years of filling out forms and waiting, you've finally acquired your banking license.  
#### This means you are now officially eligible to open your own bank, hurray!  
####   
#### Your first priority is to get the IT systems up and running.  
#### After a day of hard work, you can already open and close accounts, as well as handle withdrawals and deposits.  
####   
#### Since you couldn't be bothered writing tests, you invite some friends to help test the system.  
#### However, after just five minutes, one of your friends claims they've lost money!  
#### While you're confident your code is bug-free, you start looking through the logs to investigate.  
####   
#### Ah yes, just as you suspected, your friend is at fault!  
#### They shared their test credentials with another friend, and together they conspired to make deposits and withdrawals from the same account _in parallel_.  
#### Who would do such a thing?  
####   
#### While you argue that it's physically _impossible_ for someone to access their account in parallel, your friend smugly notifies you that the banking rules _require_ you to support this.  
#### Thus, no parallel banking support, no go-live signal.  
#### Sighing, you create a mental note to work on this tomorrow.  
#### This will set your launch date back at _least_ one more day, but well...  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
####   
#### As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), your bank software must allow accounts to be safely accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.  
#### For example, there may be many deposits and withdrawals occurring in parallel; you need to ensure there are no [race conditions][wikipedia] between when you read the account balance and set the new balance.  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
####   
#### [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.cpp bank_account.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a thread-safe bank account system that supports deposits, withdrawals, and account status (open/closed). Since multiple threads can access the account simultaneously, we need to use synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

Since we're using C++, we can use a mutex to protect access to the account balance and status. Let's implement this.

First, we need to include necessary headers and modify the class definition to include:
1. A balance member
2. An account status (open/closed)
3. A mutex to synchronize access

However, we need to be careful about the types we use. Let's use std::int64_t for the balance to handle money amounts.

Here are the necessary changes:

bank_account.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
=======
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <mutex>

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {
public:
    Bankaccount();
    void open();
    void close();
    void deposit(std::int64_t amount);
    void withdraw(std::int64_t amount);
    std::int64_t balance() const;
    
private:
    mutable std::mutex mtx;
    std::int64_t current_balance;
    bool is_open;
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the methods in the .cpp file. We need to ensure all operations are thread-safe by using the mutex to lock during critical sections.

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "bank_account.h"

namespace Bankaccount {}
=======
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : current_balance(0), is_open(false) {
}

void Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is already open");
    }
    is_open = true;
    current_balance = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is not open");
    }
    is_open = false;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    current_balance += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    if (amount > current_balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    current_balance -= amount;
}

std::int64_t Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    return current_balance;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to ensure all operations check if the account is open
2. We need to throw appropriate exceptions when operations are invalid
3. We need to use a mutex to protect all access to member variables
4. The balance() function is const, so we need to make the mutex mutable to allow locking in const member functions

This implementation ensures thread safety by using a mutex to protect all access to the account's state. Every operation locks the mutex, performs its work, and then unlocks the mutex, ensuring no race conditions occur.

However, there's a potential issue: the balance could be negative, but according to the implementation, we check if the withdrawal amount is greater than the current balance and throw an exception, which prevents negative balances.

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
1. Thread-safe access to the account
2. Support for opening and closing accounts
3. Proper handling of deposits and withdrawals
4. Operations fail on closed accounts by throwing exceptions

Let me know if you have any questions or need further modifications.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to match the expected interface. The provided code may be part of a test framework that expects specific function signatures. Let's fix this.

However, the implementation needs to be thread-safe and handle the account status correctly. Let's make sure all operations are properly synchronized.

Wait, the class name in the header is `Bankaccount` (note the lowercase 'a' in 'account'), which matches the namespace. But the implementation uses `Bankaccount` consistently. That seems correct.

But the implementation needs to match the interface. Let's ensure all function signatures match. Since the implementation looks correct, perhaps there's an issue with the function signatures or the way they're being used.

Wait, the implementation seems to be correct, but perhaps the tests expect different behavior:
1. Maybe the account should be open when constructed
2. Maybe the functions should have different names
3. Maybe the balance should be accessible even when the account is closed

But the instructions say:
1. It should be possible to close an account
2. Operations against a closed account must fail

Since the implementation matches this, perhaps there's another issue.

Wait, the implementation throws exceptions, which may not be what the tests expect. Maybe the tests expect the functions to return error codes or have different behavior.

However, without knowing the exact test cases, it's hard to say. Let's assume the implementation needs to be adjusted to match some specific interface.

Actually, the implementation looks correct for the requirements:
1. Thread-safe using a mutex
2. Checks if account is open before operations
3. Validates amounts
4. Prevents negative balance on withdrawal

Perhaps the issue is with the function signatures. Let's make sure they match exactly what's expected.

Wait, the class name is `Bankaccount` which matches the namespace, which is unusual. Maybe it should be different.

But the implementation seems to be correct. Let's proceed with the current implementation.

Since the user provided the files, and they seem to match, perhaps there are no errors. But the user mentioned to fix any errors below marked with █, which suggests there might be issues with those lines.

Wait, the marked lines are:
1. deposit, withdraw, balance function declarations
2. private section
3. current_balance member

These seem fine. Maybe the issue is that the implementation needs to be in a specific way that's not yet clear.

Perhaps the tests expect the account to be initially open, but our implementation starts closed and needs to be explicitly opened.

Wait, the instructions say:
1. It should be possible to open and close accounts
2. So probably the account starts closed and needs to be opened

This matches our implementation.

Since I can't see any obvious issues, I'll assume the implementation is correct. If there are specific test failures, we'd need to see those to make appropriate changes.

However, to be thorough, let's make sure all types are correct according to the MISRA rules:
1. We're using std::int64_t which is a standard fixed-width type
2. All operations are properly synchronized
3. All assignments are between compatible types

This implementation seems to follow the rules:
1. We use std::int64_t consistently
2. No narrowing conversions
3. All operations are properly parenthesized where necessary

Since the implementation seems correct, and the user hasn't provided specific error messages, I'll assume it's fine. If there are specific issues, please provide more details.
