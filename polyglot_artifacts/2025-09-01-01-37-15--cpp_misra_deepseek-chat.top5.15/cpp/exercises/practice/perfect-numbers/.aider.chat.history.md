#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of [perfect](#perfect), [abundant](#abundant), or [deficient](#deficient) based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The _aliquot sum_ is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of `15` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.  
####   
#### ## Perfect  
####   
#### A number is perfect when it equals its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `6` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`  
#### - `28` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`  
####   
#### ## Abundant  
####   
#### A number is abundant when it is less than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `12` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
#### - `24` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36`  
####   
#### ## Deficient  
####   
#### A number is deficient when it is greater than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `8` is a deficient number because `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`  
#### - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is [perfect](#perfect).  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is [abundant](#abundant) or [deficient](#deficient).

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: perfect_numbers.cpp perfect_numbers.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. We need to implement a classification for numbers based on their aliquot sum. Let's think through this carefully.

Since we need to determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient, we'll need a function that can classify a number into one of these categories. Let's implement this.

First, we need to include the necessary headers and define the classification types. Since we're dealing with positive integers, we can use an enumeration to represent the classification.

However, the instructions don't specify the exact function signatures, so we need to be careful. Let's assume we need to implement a function that takes a number and returns its classification.

Wait, the files provided are empty namespaces, so we need to add our implementation. Let's define an enum class to represent the classifications.

Here's the plan:
1. Add an enum class to the header to represent number classifications
2. Implement a function to classify numbers based on their aliquot sum
3. Make sure to handle edge cases (like numbers less than 1)

Since the aliquot sum is the sum of proper divisors (excluding the number itself), we need to find all divisors and sum them up.

Here are the necessary changes:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int64_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the classify function in perfect_numbers.cpp:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case (its only proper divisor is 0)
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 0;
    for (std::int64_t i = 1; i <= number / 2; i++) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to include <stdexcept> for std::domain_error
2. We're using std::int64_t to handle potentially large numbers
3. We're checking for numbers <= 0 and throwing an exception
4. We're handling 1 as a special case since its only proper divisor is 0
5. We're summing up all divisors up to number/2 to find the aliquot sum

This implementation should work, but let's test the logic:
- For number = 6: divisors are 1, 2, 3 → sum = 6 → perfect
- For number = 12: divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → sum = 16 → abundant
- For number = 8: divisors are 1, 2, 4 → sum = 7 → deficient
- For number = 1: no divisors in the loop (i <= 0.5) → sum remains 0 → 0 < 1 → deficient

Wait, the loop condition for number = 1 would be i <= 0.5, which is always false since i starts at 1, so sum remains 0, which matches our special case handling.

This implementation should be correct. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to follow the MISRA C++ rules provided. Let's fix the issues:

1. The function declaration uses std::int64_t directly, which violates the rule about not using standard integer types
2. We need to use a typedef/using alias for integer types

Let's fix the header first:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int64_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

using number_t = std::int64_t;

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(number_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's fix the implementation to use the alias and ensure all operations follow the rules:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case (its only proper divisor is 0)
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 0;
    for (std::int64_t i = 1; i <= number / 2; i++) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(number_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case (its only proper divisor is 0)
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    number_t sum = 0;
    for (number_t i = 1; i <= (number / 2); i++) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else {
        if (sum > number) {
            return classification::abundant;
        } else {
            return classification::deficient;
        }
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We're now using number_t consistently throughout
2. We've added parentheses around (number / 2) to be explicit about precedence
3. We've restructured the if-else to always use compound statements (braces)
4. All types are now using our alias number_t which is based on a fixed-width type

This implementation should now follow the provided MISRA C++ rules:
1. No direct use of standard integer types
2. All if/else statements use compound statements
3. Parentheses are used appropriately
4. No mixing of types

However, there's one potential issue: the comparison `number <= 0` might be between different types if 0 is treated as an int. But since number_t is std::int64_t, and 0 can be implicitly converted to std::int64_t, this should be fine according to the rules (integer constant expression that fits the target's range).

Wait, the rules say:
"Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target's range"
Since 0 fits in std::int64_t, it's okay.

This implementation should now be correct and follow all the specified rules. Let's proceed.

I understand. The issue is that we're using `std::int64_t` directly in the `using` alias, which violates the rule about not using standard integer types. Let's fix this by using a fixed-width type from `<cstdint>` properly.

Wait, the rule says:
"The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used"
But `std::int64_t` is a fixed-width type from `<cstdint>`, which should be allowed according to the instructions:
"Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, etc."

Perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let's re-read the rule:
"The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used"
This refers to types like int, long, unsigned int, etc., not the fixed-width types from <cstdint>.

But the instruction says to use fixed-width types, which we're doing. Maybe the issue is elsewhere.

Wait, the error markers are on lines 8 and 13, which are:
8: using number_t = std::int64_t;
13: deficient

Perhaps the issue is that 'deficient' is not properly aligned or there's a missing comma, but it looks fine.
Wait, the enum looks correct.

Maybe the issue is that the function declaration needs to be adjusted. Let's make sure everything is correct.

Actually, the implementation seems fine. Let's proceed with the current implementation, as it follows the instructions:
1. We're including <cstdint>
2. We're using a fixed-width type (std::int64_t)
3. We're creating an alias (number_t) to use instead of the raw type

Since the implementation seems correct, perhaps the error is elsewhere. Let's make sure the implementation follows all the rules:

1. All if/else use compound statements: Yes
2. Parentheses are used appropriately: Let's check
   - `i <= (number / 2)` has parentheses
   - `(number % i) == 0` has parentheses
3. No mixing of types: All types are number_t
4. No character numerical values: Not applicable here

Wait, the implementation looks good. Let's not change anything unless there are specific errors to fix.

Since the user provided the files and marked lines, but didn't specify the exact error, I'll assume the implementation is correct as is. If there are specific errors, please provide more details.
