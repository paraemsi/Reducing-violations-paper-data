#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a clock that handles times without dates.  
####   
#### You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.  
####   
#### Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.cpp clock.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a clock class that can handle times without dates, support adding and subtracting minutes, and ensure that two clocks representing the same time are considered equal. Let's think through this implementation.

Since we're dealing with times, we can represent the time in minutes since midnight (0-1439 minutes per day). This makes it easy to add and subtract minutes while normalizing to valid times.

However, the instructions don't specify the exact interface, but typically, we'd have a Clock class with:
1. A constructor that takes hours and minutes
2. Methods to add and subtract minutes
3. Equality comparison
4. A way to get the time as a string

Since the namespace is date_independent, and the files are nearly empty, we need to implement everything.

Let's implement a Clock class that stores minutes since midnight, and provide the necessary functionality.

Wait, the instructions say not to change the names of existing functions or classes, but the files are empty. So we need to add our implementation.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a Clock class in the clock.h header
2. Implement its methods in clock.cpp
3. Make sure to handle wrapping around days when adding/subtracting minutes
4. Ensure proper formatting of the time string

Here are the necessary changes:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
=======
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

#include <string>
#include <cstdint>

namespace date_independent {

class clock {
private:
    std::int32_t minutes_since_midnight;
    clock(std::int32_t minutes);
    
public:
    static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
    clock plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const;
    clock minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const;
    operator std::string() const;
    bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
    bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;
};

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in clock.cpp:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {

clock::clock(std::int32_t minutes) : minutes_since_midnight(minutes) {
}

clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
    // Convert everything to minutes and normalize to be within 0-1439
    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
    // Handle negative values by adding enough days to make it positive
    total_minutes %= 1440;
    if (total_minutes < 0) {
        total_minutes += 1440;
    }
    return clock(total_minutes);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const {
    std::int32_t new_minutes = (minutes_since_midnight + minutes_to_add) % 1440;
    if (new_minutes < 0) {
        new_minutes += 1440;
    }
    return clock(new_minutes);
}

clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const {
    return this->plus(-minutes_to_subtract);
}

clock::operator std::string() const {
    std::int32_t hours = minutes_since_midnight / 60;
    std::int32_t minutes = minutes_since_midnight % 60;
    
    // Normalize hours to be within 0-23
    hours %= 24;
    if (hours < 0) {
        hours += 24;
    }
    
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
        << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << minutes;
    return oss.str();
}

bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
    return (minutes_since_midnight == other.minutes_since_midnight);
}

bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
    return !(*this == other);
}

}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The implementation uses std::int32_t which follows the rules
2. All operations are done in a way that always keeps the time valid
3. The time is always normalized to be within 0-1439 minutes
4. The string formatting uses leading zeros
5. We've added operators for equality and inequality

This implementation should handle:
- Adding and subtracting minutes, which can wrap around days
- Comparing clocks for equality based on their time
- Formatting the time as HH:MM

However, the implementation of plus and minus needs to handle large numbers correctly, which it does by using modulo 1440 (number of minutes in a day).

This implementation should meet all the requirements:
1. Handle times without dates
2. Add and subtract minutes
3. Two clocks representing the same time are equal
4. Follows the provided rules

Let me know if you have any questions or if there are any issues with this implementation.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle the normalization correctly and to ensure all operations are valid. Let's fix the implementation.

The key is to always normalize the total minutes to be within 0-1439 (number of minutes in a day). Let's make sure that when we add or subtract minutes, we always get a valid time.

However, there's an issue with the implementation of the normalization. Let's fix that by always normalizing to a positive number within 0-1439.

Here are the necessary fixes:

clock.cpp

    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
    // Handle negative values by adding enough days to make it positive
    total_minutes %= 1440;
    if (total_minutes < 0) {
        total_minutes += 1440;
    }
    return clock(total_minutes);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const {
    std::int32_t new_minutes = (minutes_since_midnight + minutes_to_add) % 1440;
    if (new_minutes < 0) {
        new_minutes += 1440;
    }
    return clock(new_minutes);
}

clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const {

    // So no need for additional normalization

bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {

}

}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue: when hours and minutes are passed to `at()`, they could be negative or very large. The implementation needs to handle that correctly. Let's test our approach:

1. Convert hours and minutes to total minutes
2. Normalize total minutes to be within 0-1439 using modulo arithmetic
3. Always adjust to be positive by adding 1440 if negative

This should work for all cases:
- If hours is negative, total_minutes will be negative, and we'll normalize it correctly
- If minutes is negative, same thing
- Large values will wrap around correctly

Also, in the string conversion, since minutes_since_midnight is always between 0-1439, hours will always be between 0-23, and minutes between 0-59, so no additional normalization is needed there.

This implementation should now correctly handle:
- Adding and subtracting minutes
- Equality comparisons
- String representation in HH:MM format

Let me know if there are any further issues.
