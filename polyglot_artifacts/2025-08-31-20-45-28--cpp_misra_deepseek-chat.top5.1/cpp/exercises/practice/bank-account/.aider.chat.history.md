#### # Introduction  
####   
#### After years of filling out forms and waiting, you've finally acquired your banking license.  
#### This means you are now officially eligible to open your own bank, hurray!  
####   
#### Your first priority is to get the IT systems up and running.  
#### After a day of hard work, you can already open and close accounts, as well as handle withdrawals and deposits.  
####   
#### Since you couldn't be bothered writing tests, you invite some friends to help test the system.  
#### However, after just five minutes, one of your friends claims they've lost money!  
#### While you're confident your code is bug-free, you start looking through the logs to investigate.  
####   
#### Ah yes, just as you suspected, your friend is at fault!  
#### They shared their test credentials with another friend, and together they conspired to make deposits and withdrawals from the same account _in parallel_.  
#### Who would do such a thing?  
####   
#### While you argue that it's physically _impossible_ for someone to access their account in parallel, your friend smugly notifies you that the banking rules _require_ you to support this.  
#### Thus, no parallel banking support, no go-live signal.  
#### Sighing, you create a mental note to work on this tomorrow.  
#### This will set your launch date back at _least_ one more day, but well...  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
####   
#### As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), your bank software must allow accounts to be safely accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.  
#### For example, there may be many deposits and withdrawals occurring in parallel; you need to ensure there are no [race conditions][wikipedia] between when you read the account balance and set the new balance.  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
####   
#### [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.cpp bank_account.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. We need to implement a thread-safe bank account class that supports deposits, withdrawals, and account status (open/closed). Since multiple threads can access the account simultaneously, we need to use proper synchronization to prevent race conditions.

Since this is C++, we'll use a mutex to protect access to the account balance and status. Let's implement this:

1. Add necessary includes
2. Add a balance member variable
3. Add a boolean to track if the account is open
4. Add a mutex to synchronize access
5. Implement the methods to handle deposits, withdrawals, etc.

However, the class definition needs to be updated to include these members and methods. Let's start with the header file.

Here are the necessary changes:

bank_account.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
=======
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <mutex>

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {
private:
    std::int64_t balance;
    bool is_open;
    mutable std::mutex mtx;
    
public:
    Bankaccount();
    void deposit(std::int64_t amount);
    void withdraw(std::int64_t amount);
    void close();
    std::int64_t get_balance() const;
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these methods in the cpp file. We need to ensure all operations are thread-safe by using the mutex to lock during critical sections.

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "bank_account.h"

namespace Bankaccount {}
=======
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : balance(0), is_open(true) {
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Invalid deposit amount");
    }
    balance += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Invalid withdrawal amount");
    }
    if (amount > balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    balance -= amount;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    is_open = false;
}

std::int64_t Bankaccount::get_balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    return balance;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We're using std::int64_t to represent the balance, which should be sufficient for monetary amounts
2. All operations are protected by a mutex to ensure thread safety
3. We check if the account is open before performing operations
4. We validate input amounts to ensure they're positive
5. For withdrawals, we also check if there are sufficient funds

This implementation should handle parallel access safely. Let's break down each operation:
- deposit: Locks the mutex, checks if account is open, validates amount, updates balance
- withdraw: Locks the mutex, checks if account is open, validates amount, checks for sufficient funds, updates balance
- close: Locks the mutex, marks account as closed
- get_balance: Locks the mutex, checks if account is open, returns balance

Since the mutex is mutable, we can lock it in const member functions like get_balance().

This implementation should now support the requirements:
1. Thread-safe access from multiple threads
2. Operations fail on closed accounts
3. Proper validation of amounts
4. Preventing race conditions when reading and updating the balance

However, the instructions don't specify what the initial balance should be, but it makes sense to start at 0 when the account is opened.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to follow the MISRA C++ rules provided. Let's fix the issues:

1. The names of the standard signed integer types should not be used directly
2. We need to use fixed-width types
3. We need to ensure proper parentheses in expressions
4. All if/else statements need compound statements
5. We need to ensure appropriate assignments between numeric types

Since the interface uses std::int64_t, which is a fixed-width type, it's actually fine according to the rules. But to be precise, we should use a typedef/using alias if exact width isn't critical, but in this case, it seems critical to use a fixed-width type.

Wait, the rules say:
"The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used"
But std::int64_t is from <cstdint>, which is allowed.

However, the implementation needs to follow other rules:
1. Add parentheses to expressions
2. Ensure all if/else have compound statements
3. Check for appropriate assignments

Let's fix the implementation:

Here are the necessary changes:

bank_account.cpp
```cpp

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : balance(0), is_open(true) {

    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Invalid deposit amount");
    }
    balance += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {

    }
    if (amount <= 0) {

    }
    if (amount > balance) {

    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Invalid deposit amount");

    balance = (balance + amount);

    }

```

However, I notice that the implementation already uses compound statements for if conditions, which is good. I added parentheses around arithmetic operations to make precedence explicit, which follows the rule:
"Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression."

But actually, the += and -= operators are compound assignment operators, which have their own precedence. Since we're replacing them with = and +/-, we need to ensure proper parentheses.

Wait, the original implementation used += and -= which are not explicitly mentioned in the rules. To be safe, I've replaced them with explicit assignments with parenthesized expressions.

This implementation should now follow the provided MISRA C++ rules:
1. Using fixed-width integer types from <cstdint>
2. All if statements have compound bodies
3. Arithmetic expressions are properly parenthesized
4. No mixing of numeric types (all amounts are std::int64_t)
5. No character numerical value issues (not relevant here)

However, the rules also mention:
"Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate"
Since all types are std::int64_t, this is fine.

This implementation should now be thread-safe and follow the specified coding standards. Let's run through the operations:
1. All operations are protected by a mutex
2. Account status is checked before performing operations
3. Amounts are validated
4. Sufficient funds are checked before withdrawal
5. Closed accounts throw exceptions on operations

This should meet the requirements for parallel access to bank accounts while following the provided coding guidelines.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in bank_account.cpp bank_account.h to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests expect certain public member functions that aren't implemented:
1. An `open()` method to open the account
2. A `balance()` method to get the balance (not to be confused with the private member variable)
3. The account should start closed and need to be opened

Let's fix the implementation to match the test expectations:

Here are the necessary changes:

```

Key changes made:
1. Added an `open()` method to open the account, which sets is_open to true and initializes balance to 0
2. Renamed `get_balance()` to `balance()` to match the test expectations
3. The account now starts closed (is_open = false)
4. Added proper error handling for trying to open an already open account
5. Added proper error handling for trying to close a non-open account
6. All operations are still thread-safe using the mutex

This implementation should now match what the tests expect:
1. The account needs to be explicitly opened
2. The balance is accessed via a `balance()` method
3. All operations are thread-safe
4. Closed accounts throw exceptions on operations
5. Deposits and withdrawals are validated

This should now pass the tests while maintaining thread safety and following the provided coding guidelines.

I understand. The issue is that the member function `balance()` has the same name as the member variable `balance`, which can cause conflicts. Let's fix this by renaming the member variable to avoid naming conflicts.

This change renames the member variables to use a prefix (like `m_`) to distinguish them from member function names:
1. `balance` -> `m_balance`
2. `is_open` -> `m_is_open`
3. `mtx` -> `m_mtx`

This should resolve the naming conflict between the member variable `balance` and the member function `balance()`, while maintaining all the functionality:
1. Thread safety through mutex locking
2. Proper account state management (open/closed)
3. Validation of operations
4. Exception throwing for invalid operations

The implementation remains the same in terms of behavior, just with different internal variable names to avoid naming conflicts.

I understand. The issue is that the implementation needs to follow the MISRA C++ rules provided earlier. Let's fix the implementation to ensure it complies with these rules:

1. All if/else statements must have compound statements (braces)
2. Parentheses must be used to indicate operator precedence
3. No numerical values of characters (not applicable here)
4. Appropriate assignments between numeric types

Wait, the implementation already uses compound statements for if conditions, which is good. Let's ensure all arithmetic operations are properly parenthesized.

However, the implementation looks correct. Let's check if there are any issues with the provided code:

Actually, the implementation seems to follow the rules:
1. All if statements have compound bodies
2. Arithmetic operations are parenthesized
3. No character numerical values are used
4. All numeric types are consistent (std::int64_t)

But perhaps the issue is with the amount validation. Let's make sure all conditions are properly parenthesized:

Wait, the rules say:
"Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level."

Let's ensure all conditions are properly parenthesized:

Here are the necessary fixes:

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(m_mtx);
    if (!m_is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Invalid deposit amount");
    }
    m_balance = (m_balance + amount);
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(m_mtx);
    if (!m_is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Invalid withdrawal amount");
    }
    if (amount > m_balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    m_balance = (m_balance - amount);
}
=======
void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(m_mtx);
    if (!m_is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Invalid deposit amount");
    }
    m_balance = (m_balance + amount);
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(m_mtx);
    if (!m_is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Invalid withdrawal amount");
    }
    if ((amount > m_balance)) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    m_balance = (m_balance - amount);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Wait, the rules also mention:
"Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with &&, ||, or ?:."
But in our implementation, we don't have any combined conditions, so this is fine.

However, to be thorough, let's ensure all conditions are properly parenthesized:

Actually, the implementation seems correct. Let's add parentheses to the amount > m_balance condition to be explicit.

This change adds parentheses around the condition in the withdraw method to make it explicit:
(amount > m_balance)

This should now comply with the MISRA C++ rules:
1. All if statements have compound bodies
2. All conditions are properly parenthesized
3. All arithmetic operations are parenthesized
4. No character numerical values are used
5. All numeric types are consistent

This implementation should now be correct and follow the provided guidelines while maintaining thread safety and proper account management.
