#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of [perfect](#perfect), [abundant](#abundant), or [deficient](#deficient) based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The _aliquot sum_ is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of `15` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.  
####   
#### ## Perfect  
####   
#### A number is perfect when it equals its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `6` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`  
#### - `28` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`  
####   
#### ## Abundant  
####   
#### A number is abundant when it is less than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `12` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
#### - `24` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36`  
####   
#### ## Deficient  
####   
#### A number is deficient when it is greater than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `8` is a deficient number because `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`  
#### - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is [perfect](#perfect).  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is [abundant](#abundant) or [deficient](#deficient).

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: perfect_numbers.cpp perfect_numbers.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. We need to implement a classification for numbers based on their aliquot sum. Let's implement this functionality in the provided files.

Since we need to determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient, we'll need a function that can classify a number into one of these categories. Let's use an enumeration to represent these classifications.

First, let's update the header file to include the necessary declarations:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int64_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the `classify` function in the source file. We need to calculate the aliquot sum and compare it to the number to determine its classification.

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Classification is only for positive integers");
    }
    
    // Calculate the aliquot sum
    std::int64_t sum = 0;
    for (std::int64_t i = 1; i <= std::sqrt(number); i++) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            if (i != (number / i) && (number / i) != number) {
                sum += (number / i);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Adjust sum to not include the number itself
    // Since factors are added in pairs, and number itself is not added due to the condition above
    // But 1 is a special case
    // Let's make sure we're not including the number itself
    // The implementation above ensures that when i is a factor, we add i and number/i
    // But number/i could be equal to number when i=1, which we need to exclude
    // So we added a condition to not add number when number/i equals number
    
    // Compare sum to number
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a slight issue: when number is 1, its factors are just 1, but we need to exclude the number itself from the aliquot sum. So the aliquot sum should be 0. Let's test our implementation:
- For number=1: sum=0 → 0 < 1 → deficient (correct)
- For number=6: factors are 1,2,3,6 → sum=1+2+3=6 → perfect (correct)
- For number=28: factors are 1,2,4,7,14,28 → sum=1+2+4+7+14=28 → perfect (correct)

Wait, but our implementation may not correctly handle the number itself. Let's fix that by always ensuring we don't include the number itself in the sum.

Wait, the implementation above uses a condition to not add (number / i) when it equals number, which happens when i=1. So it should work:
- For i=1: add 1, and number/i=number, but we check if (number / i) != number, which is false when i=1, so we don't add number
- So sum remains correct

This implementation should work. Let's also add the necessary include for domain_error:

Wait, we need to include <stdexcept> to use std::domain_error.

Wait, let's fix that:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>
#include <stdexcept>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should now correctly classify numbers based on their aliquot sum. Let's test the cases:
1. Perfect numbers: 6, 28
2. Abundant numbers: 12, 24
3. Deficient numbers: 8, prime numbers
4. Edge case: 1 (deficient)

This implementation should handle all these cases correctly. Let's proceed.

I notice that the implementation may not be handling the aliquot sum correctly. The aliquot sum should be the sum of all proper divisors (factors excluding the number itself). Let's fix the implementation to ensure we're not including the number itself in the sum.

The current implementation tries to avoid adding the number itself through a condition, but it's better to be explicit. Let's find all divisors and sum them, excluding the number itself.

Here's a revised approach:
1. For numbers equal to 1, the aliquot sum is 0 (no proper divisors)
2. For other numbers, find all divisors up to number/2 and sum them
3. But this can be optimized by going up to the square root

Wait, but to find all divisors, we can use the square root approach, but we need to be careful:
1. For each i from 1 to sqrt(number)
2. If number % i == 0, then both i and number/i are divisors
3. Add both to the sum, but make sure to exclude number itself

Let's fix the implementation:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Classification is only for positive integers");
    }
    
    // Calculate the aliquot sum
    std::int64_t sum = 0;
    for (std::int64_t i = 1; i <= std::sqrt(number); i++) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            if (i != (number / i) && (number / i) != number) {
                sum += (number / i);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Adjust sum to not include the number itself
    // Since factors are added in pairs, and number itself is not added due to the condition above
    // But 1 is a special case
    // Let's make sure we're not including the number itself
    // The implementation above ensures that when i is a factor, we add i and number/i
    // But number/i could be equal to number when i=1, which we need to exclude
    // So we added a condition to not add number when number/i equals number
    
    // Compare sum to number
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Classification is only for positive integers");
    }
    
    // Handle the case where number is 1 (no proper divisors)
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor for numbers > 1
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); i++) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t complement = number / i;
            if (complement != i) {
                sum += complement;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a slight issue: the implementation above always includes 1, which is correct for numbers greater than 1. But we need to make sure we're not including the number itself. Since we're only adding divisors that are less than number, and we're starting from i=2, this should be fine.

Wait, but when number is a perfect square, we might be adding the square root twice? No, because we check if complement != i.

Let's test this implementation:
- number = 6: divisors are 1, 2, 3
  i=2: 6%2==0 → sum +=2, complement=3 → sum +=3 → sum=1+2+3=6 → perfect
- number = 28: 
  i=2: 28%2==0 → sum +=2, complement=14 → sum +=14 → sum=1+2+14=17
  i=4: 28%4==0 → sum +=4, complement=7 → sum +=7 → sum=17+4+7=28 → perfect
- number = 12: 
  i=2: 12%2==0 → sum +=2, complement=6 → sum +=6 → sum=1+2+6=9
  i=3: 12%3==0 → sum +=3, complement=4 → sum +=4 → sum=9+3+4=16 → abundant
- number = 8:
  i=2: 8%2==0 → sum +=2, complement=4 → sum +=4 → sum=1+2+4=7 → deficient

This matches our expectations.

This implementation should now correctly classify numbers. Let's also make sure to handle the case where number is 1 separately, which we've done by returning deficient directly.
