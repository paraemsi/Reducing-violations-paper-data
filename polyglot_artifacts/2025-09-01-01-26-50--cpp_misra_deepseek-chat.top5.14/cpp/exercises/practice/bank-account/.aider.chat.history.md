#### # Introduction  
####   
#### After years of filling out forms and waiting, you've finally acquired your banking license.  
#### This means you are now officially eligible to open your own bank, hurray!  
####   
#### Your first priority is to get the IT systems up and running.  
#### After a day of hard work, you can already open and close accounts, as well as handle withdrawals and deposits.  
####   
#### Since you couldn't be bothered writing tests, you invite some friends to help test the system.  
#### However, after just five minutes, one of your friends claims they've lost money!  
#### While you're confident your code is bug-free, you start looking through the logs to investigate.  
####   
#### Ah yes, just as you suspected, your friend is at fault!  
#### They shared their test credentials with another friend, and together they conspired to make deposits and withdrawals from the same account _in parallel_.  
#### Who would do such a thing?  
####   
#### While you argue that it's physically _impossible_ for someone to access their account in parallel, your friend smugly notifies you that the banking rules _require_ you to support this.  
#### Thus, no parallel banking support, no go-live signal.  
#### Sighing, you create a mental note to work on this tomorrow.  
#### This will set your launch date back at _least_ one more day, but well...  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
####   
#### As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), your bank software must allow accounts to be safely accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.  
#### For example, there may be many deposits and withdrawals occurring in parallel; you need to ensure there are no [race conditions][wikipedia] between when you read the account balance and set the new balance.  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
####   
#### [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.h bank_account.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a thread-safe bank account class that supports deposits, withdrawals, and account status (open/closed). Since operations need to be thread-safe, we'll need to use mutexes to protect access to the account balance and status.

However, the provided files are quite minimal, so we need to add the necessary functionality. Let's think about what we need:
1. A way to track the account balance
2. A way to track if the account is open or closed
3. Thread-safe access using a mutex
4. Methods to deposit, withdraw, get balance, open, and close

Since the class is currently empty, we need to add these members and methods.

However, the instructions mention that operations against a closed account must fail, so we need to handle that too.

Let's implement this:

Wait, the class is in a namespace, and we need to implement it in both the header and the source file.

Here are the necessary changes:

bank_account.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
=======
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <mutex>
#include <atomic>
#include <cstdint>

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {
public:
    Bankaccount();
    void open();
    void close();
    void deposit(std::int64_t amount);
    void withdraw(std::int64_t amount);
    std::int64_t balance() const;
    
private:
    mutable std::mutex mtx;
    std::int64_t current_balance;
    bool is_open;
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation in the .cpp file:

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "bank_account.h"

namespace Bankaccount {}
=======
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : current_balance(0), is_open(false) {
}

void Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is already open");
    }
    is_open = true;
    current_balance = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is not open");
    }
    is_open = false;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    current_balance += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    if (amount > current_balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    current_balance -= amount;
}

std::int64_t Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    return current_balance;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to ensure all operations are thread-safe, which is why we use std::lock_guard to lock the mutex
2. We need to check if the account is open for every operation except opening
3. We need to validate amounts (must be positive)
4. For withdrawals, we need to check if there are sufficient funds
5. The balance() method also needs to be thread-safe, hence the mutable mutex

This implementation should handle parallel access safely by using a mutex to synchronize access to the account's state. All operations will be atomic with respect to each other, preventing race conditions.

However, the instructions don't specify what to do when invalid operations are performed, so throwing exceptions seems appropriate. This is a common way to handle such cases in C++.

Also, according to the MISRA rules, we're using std::int64_t which is appropriate for fixed-width integer types. We're also using proper locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to ensure it meets the requirements. Let's fix any issues:

1. The `deposit` and `withdraw` functions should not throw exceptions for invalid amounts, but the instructions don't specify this
2. The instructions say operations against a closed account must fail, which could mean throwing exceptions or simply doing nothing
3. Since the tests may expect certain behaviors, we need to be precise

However, the implementation seems correct, but perhaps the tests expect different error handling. Let's make sure:
1. All operations on a closed account should fail (perhaps by throwing exceptions)
2. We need to ensure thread safety

Wait, the implementation looks correct, but perhaps the issue is with the amount validation. The instructions don't say anything about validating amounts, so maybe we should remove those checks.

Let's modify the implementation to only check for account being open and sufficient funds for withdrawal:

Here are the necessary changes:

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    current_balance += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    if (amount > current_balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    current_balance -= amount;
}
=======
void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount < 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Negative deposit amount");
    }
    current_balance += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount < 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Negative withdrawal amount");
    }
    if (amount > current_balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    current_balance -= amount;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, the instructions don't specify what to do with negative amounts, but it's reasonable to prevent them to maintain account integrity. Let's keep these checks.

Wait, the implementation needs to be thread-safe, which it is by using a mutex to protect all access to the balance and is_open flag.

This implementation ensures:
1. No race conditions when accessing the account balance
2. Operations on closed accounts will fail by throwing exceptions
3. Withdrawals only succeed if there are sufficient funds
4. All operations are atomic with respect to each other

This should now meet the requirements:
1. Support parallel access through proper synchronization
2. Handle opening and closing of accounts
3. Prevent operations on closed accounts
4. Support deposits and withdrawals

However, if the tests are failing due to specific error messages, we may need to adjust them to match what the tests expect. But since we don't have the test cases, we need to make reasonable assumptions.

This implementation should be correct. Let's run with this.
