#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

I understand. We need to create a class that can calculate someone's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the orbital periods are given in Earth years, we can first convert the age in seconds to Earth years, and then divide by the orbital period of each planet to get the age on that planet.

First, let's define the class structure. We'll need:
1. A constructor that takes the age in seconds
2. Member functions to get the age on each planet
3. Store the age in seconds as a member variable

Wait, the instructions don't specify the exact interface, but since it's a class, we need to implement it appropriately.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a private member to store age in seconds
2. Add public member functions for each planet to return the age on that planet
3. The age on each planet is (age in Earth years) / (orbital period)
4. Age in Earth years is (age in seconds) / 31557600

Let's implement this:

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    long long age_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(long long seconds);
    long long seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in space_age.cpp:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 0.2408467);
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 0.61519726);
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_seconds / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 1.8808158);
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 11.862615);
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 29.447498);
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 84.016846);
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 164.79132);
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a note that one Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, which is exactly 365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60 = 31557600 seconds, which matches our implementation.

This implementation should work by:
1. Storing the age in seconds when the object is constructed
2. Providing a way to get the raw seconds
3. Calculating the age on each planet by dividing the Earth years age by the orbital period
4. Using floating point division to get precise results

Since the orbital periods are precise, we need to use floating point numbers to maintain accuracy. Using 31557600.0 ensures we're doing floating point division rather than integer division.

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
- Calculate age on each planet based on the given orbital periods
- Handle the age in seconds correctly
- Be precise enough for the calculations

Let me know if you have any questions or if there are any issues with this implementation.

I understand. The implementation needs to be precise and match the expected interface. Let's make sure all calculations are accurate and the implementation is correct.

However, the implementation looks correct at first glance. Let's check if there are any issues:
1. The `seconds()` function should return the age in seconds, which it does
2. All planet age calculations should be correct
3. We need to ensure floating point precision is sufficient

Wait, the implementation seems correct. But perhaps the issue is with the number of decimal places or precision? Or maybe the implementation needs to be more precise by using exact values.

Actually, the problem might be that the implementation needs to be more precise by using exact ratios. Let's use the exact orbital periods and ensure we're using precise floating point operations.

But the implementation seems correct. Let's see:
1. One Earth year is exactly 31557600 seconds (365.25 days)
2. Age on a planet is (age in seconds) / (orbital period * 31557600)

Wait, the implementation is correct. Maybe the issue is that the tests expect a certain precision, so we need to round to 2 decimal places? But the instructions don't specify that.

Actually, the implementation seems correct. Perhaps the issue is that the `seconds()` function needs to be implemented differently? Or maybe there's a typo.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Let's make sure all numbers are precise:
1. Use the exact numbers from the table
2. Make sure all operations are floating point

But the implementation already does that. Maybe the issue is that we need to use more precise numbers by not multiplying in the denominator? Let's pre-calculate the divisor for each planet to avoid potential precision issues.

Wait, let's reorganize the implementation to be more precise:

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Perhaps the issue is that the tests expect the age to be in a specific format or precision.

Actually, let's make sure we're using the exact values from the table and not introducing any rounding errors.

Here's a revised implementation that might be more precise:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const {

    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 0.2408467);

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation uses `on_earth()` as a base and divides by the orbital period, which might be more precise and is certainly more readable. It also avoids potential precision issues from multiplying large numbers.

However, if there are still issues, we might need to use more precise floating point numbers or ensure that the calculations match exactly what the tests expect. Let's see if this helps.

This implementation should be functionally identical to the previous one, but it's more maintainable and might help with precision by reusing the Earth age calculation.

If there are still issues, please provide more specific error messages or details about what's expected versus what's being received.
