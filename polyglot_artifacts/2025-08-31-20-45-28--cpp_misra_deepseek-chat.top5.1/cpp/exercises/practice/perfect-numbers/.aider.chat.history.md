#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of [perfect](#perfect), [abundant](#abundant), or [deficient](#deficient) based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The _aliquot sum_ is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of `15` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.  
####   
#### ## Perfect  
####   
#### A number is perfect when it equals its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `6` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`  
#### - `28` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`  
####   
#### ## Abundant  
####   
#### A number is abundant when it is less than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `12` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
#### - `24` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36`  
####   
#### ## Deficient  
####   
#### A number is deficient when it is greater than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `8` is a deficient number because `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`  
#### - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is [perfect](#perfect).  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is [abundant](#abundant) or [deficient](#deficient).

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: perfect_numbers.h perfect_numbers.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a classification for numbers based on their aliquot sum. Let's think through this carefully.

Since we need to determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient, we'll need a function that can classify a number into one of these categories. Let's add an enum to represent these classifications and a function to compute the classification.

However, the instructions mention that depending on the language track, we may need to implement all three classifications. Since the task says to determine whether a number is perfect, but the examples show all three, it's best to implement all three to be safe.

Since we're working with C++, we need to include the appropriate headers and follow the MISRA rules.

First, let's update the header file to declare the classification enum and function:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int64_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the classify function in the .cpp file. We need to calculate the aliquot sum and compare it to the number to determine the classification.

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t aliquot_sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            aliquot_sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                aliquot_sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (aliquot_sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (aliquot_sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to include <stdexcept> for std::domain_error
2. We need to include <cmath> for std::sqrt
3. We need to handle edge cases like 1 which has no proper divisors other than itself
4. We need to ensure we're following the MISRA rules, which we are by using std::int64_t

This implementation should work by finding all proper divisors and summing them up. Since proper divisors come in pairs, we can optimize by only checking up to the square root of the number.

Wait, the aliquot sum is the sum of proper divisors, which are all divisors except the number itself. So we need to make sure we're not including the number itself, which we're not doing in our implementation.

However, for numbers that are perfect squares, we need to be careful not to add the square root twice, which we handle by checking if other_divisor != i.

This implementation should be efficient and correct. Let's test it with the provided examples:
- 6: proper divisors are 1, 2, 3 → sum is 6 → perfect
- 28: proper divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 → sum is 28 → perfect
- 12: proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → sum is 16 → abundant
- 24: proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 → sum is 36 → abundant
- 8: proper divisors are 1, 2, 4 → sum is 7 → deficient
- Prime numbers: proper divisors are just 1 → sum is 1 which is less than the number → deficient

This matches all the examples.

I understand. Let's fix the implementation to ensure it's correct and follows the requirements. The main issue seems to be with the implementation of the `classify` function. Let's think through this carefully.

The aliquot sum should include all proper divisors (excluding the number itself). So for number=1, the proper divisors are none, so the aliquot sum is 0, which is less than 1, making it deficient.

However, the implementation needs to be efficient and correct. Let's fix the implementation:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t aliquot_sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            aliquot_sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                aliquot_sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (aliquot_sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (aliquot_sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 separately
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1; // 1 is always a divisor
    // Find all divisors up to the square root
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t complement = number / i;
            if (complement != i) {
                sum += complement;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Now compare the sum to the number
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue: the aliquot sum should not include the number itself, but our implementation never adds the number, so it's correct. Let's test our implementation with some examples:

1. number = 6:
   Divisors: 1, 2, 3
   Sum: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 → perfect

2. number = 28:
   Divisors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14
   Sum: 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28 → perfect

3. number = 12:
   Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
   Sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 > 12 → abundant

4. number = 1:
   No divisors to add beyond initialization
   Sum: 1 → but wait, 1 is not a proper divisor of itself
   Proper divisors of 1 are none, so sum should be 0
   But our implementation sets sum to 1, which is incorrect

Wait, the aliquot sum is the sum of proper divisors, which are all positive divisors excluding the number itself. For number=1, there are no proper divisors, so the sum should be 0, which is less than 1 → deficient.

So we need to fix the implementation to not always add 1:
1 is only a proper divisor if number > 1

Let's fix that:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    // Handle 1 separately
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1; // 1 is always a divisor
=======
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 0;
    // Add all proper divisors
    for (std::int64_t i = 1; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            // Add the divisor
            if (i != number) {
                sum += i;
            }
            // Add the complement, if it's different and not the number itself
            std::int64_t complement = number / i;
            if ((complement != i) && (complement != number)) {
                sum += complement;
            }
        }
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

But this implementation may be less efficient. Let's test number=6:
i=1: 6%1==0 → add 1, complement=6 → but complement == number, so don't add
i=2: 6%2==0 → add 2, complement=3 → add 3
i=3: 6%3==0 → but i > sqrt(6)≈2.4, so loop ends
Sum: 1 + 2 + 3 =6 → correct

Wait, i goes up to floor(sqrt(6)) which is 2, which matches
So it's correct

Wait, the loop condition needs to be i <= sqrt(number), which is correct
But to avoid floating point issues, we can use i*i <= number

Wait, but according to MISRA rules, we need to be careful with types
Let's use integer comparison

Wait, but number can be up to 2^63-1 which is large, and i*i may overflow
So using sqrt is better

This implementation should now be correct:
1. For number=1: the loop won't run (sqrt(1)=1, i starts at 1)
   But we need to handle i=1:
   i=1: number%1==0 → add i if i != number → 1 !=1 is false → don't add
   complement=1 → complement !=i is false (1==1) → don't add
   sum remains 0 → which is correct

Thus, we can remove the special case for number=1

Wait, but the loop condition is i <= sqrt(number), which for number=1 is 1 <=1 → true
So it will run once

Let's implement:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 0;
    // Add all proper divisors
    for (std::int64_t i = 1; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            // Add the divisor
            if (i != number) {
                sum += i;
            }
            // Add the complement, if it's different and not the number itself
            std::int64_t complement = number / i;
            if ((complement != i) && (complement != number)) {
                sum += complement;
            }
        }
    }
=======
    std::int64_t sum = 0;
    // Find all divisors and add them if they're proper divisors (not equal to number)
    for (std::int64_t i = 1; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            // Add the divisor if it's not the number itself
            if (i != number) {
                sum += i;
            }
            // Add the complement if it's different from i and not the number itself
            std::int64_t complement = number / i;
            if ((complement != i) && (complement != number)) {
                sum += complement;
            }
        }
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should now correctly handle all cases, including number=1 where the aliquot sum is 0, which is less than 1, making it deficient.

I understand the issue. The implementation is incorrectly calculating the aliquot sum by adding too many divisors. Let's fix that. The aliquot sum should only include proper divisors, which are all positive divisors excluding the number itself.

The problem seems to be that the implementation is adding numbers multiple times or adding numbers that shouldn't be included. Let's fix this by carefully ensuring we only add each proper divisor once.

Here's a revised approach:
1. For each divisor i where number % i == 0, both i and number/i are divisors
2. We need to make sure neither equals the number itself
3. We need to make sure we don't add the same divisor twice

Wait, the implementation seems to have an extra loop that's adding numbers twice. Let's fix that.

Here's the corrected implementation:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 0;
    // Find all divisors and add them if they're proper divisors (not equal to number)
    for (std::int64_t i = 1; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            // Add the divisor if it's not the number itself
            if (i != number) {
                sum += i;
            }
            // Add the complement if it's different from i and not the number itself
            std::int64_t complement = number / i;
            if ((complement != i) && (complement != number)) {
                sum += complement;
            }
        }
    }
    // Find all divisors up to the square root
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t complement = number / i;
            if (complement != i) {
                sum += complement;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Now compare the sum to the number
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle the case where number is 1 (no proper divisors except itself which we exclude)
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 0;
    // Find all divisors up to the square root
    for (std::int64_t i = 1; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            // Add the divisor
            if (i != number) {
                sum += i;

            if ((complement != i) && (complement != number)) {
                sum += complement;
            }
        }
    }

    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {

}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

```

However, there's a duplicate loop in the original implementation which was adding numbers twice, leading to larger sums than expected. This explains why numbers that should be perfect or deficient are being classified as abundant.

Wait, the test cases show:
- 6 should be perfect, but it's being classified as abundant
- 4 should be deficient, but it's being classified as abundant

This suggests our sum is too large, which matches with the duplicate loop theory.

Let's test our fixed implementation with number=6:
i=1: 6%1==0 → add 1, complement=6 → but complement != i (6 !=1) and complement != number (6 !=6) is false → don't add
i=2: 6%2==0 → add 2, complement=3 → complement != i (3 !=2) and complement != number (3 !=6) → add 3
i=3: 6%3==0 → but i > sqrt(6)≈2.4, so loop ends
Sum: 1 + 2 + 3 =6 → perfect

This matches what we want.

Let's test number=4:
i=1: 4%1==0 → add 1, complement=4 → complement != i (4 !=1) and complement != number (4 !=4) is false → don't add
i=2: 4%2==0 → add 2, complement=2 → complement != i (2 !=2) is false → don't add
Sum: 1 + 2 =3 <4 → deficient

This matches what we want.

This implementation should now correctly classify numbers. Let's hope this fixes the test cases.
