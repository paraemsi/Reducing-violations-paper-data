#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.  
####   
#### `a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.  
#### The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.  
#### The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.  
####   
#### The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:  
#### `(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,  
#### `(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.  
####   
#### Multiplication result is by definition  
#### `(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.  
####   
#### The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is  
#### `1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:  
#### `(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Raising e to a complex exponent can be expressed as `e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`, the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,  
#### - conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.  
####   
#### Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: complex_numbers.h complex_numbers.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I'll implement a complex number class with the required operations. Let's start by defining the class structure and then implement each operation.

Since we need to use floating point numbers, we'll use `double` for the real and imaginary parts. Let's implement:

1. Constructor to initialize real and imaginary parts
2. Real() and imag() accessors
3. Operations: +, -, *, /
4. Conjugate, abs(), and exp()

Wait, the instructions say to implement exponent of a complex number, which probably means e^z where z is complex.
Since e^z = e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))

Here are the implementations:

First, let's update the header file to define the Complex class:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_part;
    double imag_part;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement each method in the .cpp file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "complex_numbers.h"

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
#include "complex_numbers.h"

namespace complex_numbers {

Complex::Complex(double real, double imag) : real_part(real), imag_part(imag) {}

double Complex::real() const {
    return real_part;
}

double Complex::imag() const {
    return imag_part;
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_part * real_part) + (imag_part * imag_part));
}

Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_part, -imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    double exp_real = std::exp(real_part);
    return Complex(exp_real * std::cos(imag_part), exp_real * std::sin(imag_part));
}

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_part + other.real_part, imag_part + other.imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_part - other.real_part, imag_part - other.imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real = (real_part * other.real_part) - (imag_part * other.imag_part);
    double imag = (imag_part * other.real_part) + (real_part * other.imag_part);
    return Complex(real, imag);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_part * other.real_part) + (other.imag_part * other.imag_part);
    double real = ((real_part * other.real_part) + (imag_part * other.imag_part)) / denominator;
    double imag = ((imag_part * other.real_part) - (real_part * other.imag_part)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real, imag);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all operations follow the MISRA C++ rules:
1. No use of standard integer types - We're using double which is a floating point type, so this is fine
2. Assignment between numeric types - All assignments are between doubles, which is appropriate
3. Parentheses to indicate precedence - I've added parentheses where necessary
4. Compound statements for if/else - No if/else statements are used in this implementation
5. Character numerical values - Not relevant here as we're not using characters

This implementation should work for the requirements:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are implemented using operator overloading
- Conjugate, absolute value, and exponent are implemented as member functions
- All operations follow the mathematical definitions provided

Note: The implementation uses `std::sqrt`, `std::exp`, `std::cos`, and `std::sin` from the `<cmath>` header which is included.

I understand. The implementation needs to match the interface that's expected by the tests. Since the tests may be using different function names, we need to ensure our implementation matches what the tests expect. Let's look at the provided interface:

The functions are:
- real() and imag() to get the real and imaginary parts
- abs() for absolute value
- conj() for conjugate
- exp() for exponent
- Operators: +, -, *, /

Wait, but the implementation seems correct. Maybe there are other issues. Let's make sure all operations are precise and follow the mathematical definitions exactly.

However, the implementation looks correct. Let's check if there are any precision issues or if we need to handle special cases like division by zero.

Since division by a complex number where both real and imaginary parts are zero would result in division by zero, which is undefined, we need to make sure the tests don't expect us to handle that case, or we need to add error handling if required.

But since the instructions don't mention error handling, we'll proceed as is.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Maybe the issue is with the tests expecting different function signatures or names. But since we can't see the tests, we need to make sure our implementation matches the header exactly.

Actually, the implementation matches the header. Let's make sure all operations are precise by using parentheses appropriately to follow the MISRA rules:

Wait, the implementation needs to ensure proper operator precedence using parentheses. Let's review:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_part * real_part) + (imag_part * imag_part));
}
=======
double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt(((real_part * real_part) + (imag_part * imag_part)));
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::exp() const {
    double exp_real = std::exp(real_part);
    return Complex(exp_real * std::cos(imag_part), exp_real * std::sin(imag_part));
}
=======
Complex Complex::exp() const {
    double exp_real = std::exp(real_part);
    return Complex((exp_real * std::cos(imag_part)), (exp_real * std::sin(imag_part)));
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real = (real_part * other.real_part) - (imag_part * other.imag_part);
    double imag = (imag_part * other.real_part) + (real_part * other.imag_part);
    return Complex(real, imag);
}
=======
Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real = ((real_part * other.real_part) - (imag_part * other.imag_part));
    double imag = ((imag_part * other.real_part) + (real_part * other.imag_part));
    return Complex(real, imag);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_part * other.real_part) + (other.imag_part * other.imag_part);
    double real = ((real_part * other.real_part) + (imag_part * other.imag_part)) / denominator;
    double imag = ((imag_part * other.real_part) - (real_part * other.imag_part)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real, imag);
}
=======
Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = ((other.real_part * other.real_part) + (other.imag_part * other.imag_part));
    double real = (((real_part * other.real_part) + (imag_part * other.imag_part)) / denominator);
    double imag = (((imag_part * other.real_part) - (real_part * other.imag_part)) / denominator);
    return Complex(real, imag);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that all operations are properly parenthesized according to the MISRA rules. Let's also make sure all binary operations are properly grouped:

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Let's also make sure we're using the correct mathematical operations:
1. Addition and subtraction are straightforward
2. Multiplication follows (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (bc + ad)i
3. Division follows (a + bi)/(c + di) = [(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i] / (c² + d²)

This matches our implementation.

Since the implementation seems correct, and we've added appropriate parentheses, this should now comply with the MISRA rules. Let's hope this fixes any issues.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in complex_numbers.h complex_numbers.cpp to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests are trying to perform operations between complex numbers and real numbers (doubles), but our implementation only supports operations between complex numbers. We need to add support for these mixed-type operations.

Since we can't modify the tests, we need to add additional operators that can handle:
1. Complex + double
2. double + Complex
3. Complex - double
4. double - Complex
5. Complex * double
6. double * Complex
7. Complex / double
8. double / Complex

Let's add these operators. Since a double can be treated as a complex number with the imaginary part equal to zero, we can implement these operations by converting the double to a Complex number first.

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
=======
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Add operators for complex number and double
    Complex operator+(double other) const;
    Complex operator-(double other) const;
    Complex operator*(double other) const;
    Complex operator/(double other) const;
    
    // Friend functions for double and complex number operations
    friend Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these new operators in the .cpp file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = ((other.real_part * other.real_part) + (other.imag_part * other.imag_part));
    double real = (((real_part * other.real_part) + (imag_part * other.imag_part)) / denominator);
    double imag = (((imag_part * other.real_part) - (real_part * other.imag_part)) / denominator);
    return Complex(real, imag);
}
=======
Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = ((other.real_part * other.real_part) + (other.imag_part * other.imag_part));
    double real = (((real_part * other.real_part) + (imag_part * other.imag_part)) / denominator);
    double imag = (((imag_part * other.real_part) - (real_part * other.imag_part)) / denominator);
    return Complex(real, imag);
}

// Implement operators for complex number and double
Complex Complex::operator+(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_part + other), imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_part - other), imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_part * other), (imag_part * other));
}

Complex Complex::operator/(double other) const {
    return Complex((real_part / other), (imag_part / other));
}

// Implement friend functions for double and complex number operations
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs + rhs.real_part), rhs.imag_part);
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs - rhs.real_part), (-rhs.imag_part));
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real_part), (lhs * rhs.imag_part));
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To divide a double by a complex number, we can treat lhs as a complex number (lhs + 0i)
    // and use the complex division formula
    double denominator = ((rhs.real_part * rhs.real_part) + (rhs.imag_part * rhs.imag_part));
    double real = ((lhs * rhs.real_part) / denominator);
    double imag = (((-lhs) * rhs.imag_part) / denominator);
    return Complex(real, imag);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, we need to make sure these friend functions are declared in the namespace. Let's also add the necessary includes and ensure everything is properly scoped.

Wait, the friend functions are declared within the class, which makes them part of the surrounding namespace. But we need to implement them outside the class. Since they're friends, they can access private members.

This implementation should now handle all the cases where doubles are used with complex numbers:
1. complex + double: Uses the member operator+
2. double + complex: Uses the friend operator+
3. And similarly for other operations

Let's hope this resolves the compilation errors. The implementation follows the mathematical operations:
- Adding/subtracting a real number only affects the real part
- Multiplying/dividing by a real number scales both real and imaginary parts
- Dividing a real number by a complex number uses the complex division formula, treating the real number as a complex number with zero imaginary part

This should now pass all the tests. Let's proceed.

I see the issue. The friend functions need to be declared within the namespace, but they're not being found during linking. Let's move their implementations inside the class declaration or ensure they're properly declared and defined.

Actually, the friend declarations are correct, but we need to make sure they're defined in the global namespace or within the complex_numbers namespace. Since they're declared as friends, they can be found through argument-dependent lookup (ADL).

Wait, the implementation in the .cpp file needs to be in the complex_numbers namespace. Let's fix that:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Implement friend functions for double and complex number operations
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs + rhs.real_part), rhs.imag_part);
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs - rhs.real_part), (-rhs.imag_part));
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real_part), (lhs * rhs.imag_part));
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {

```

This ensures that the friend functions are defined within the same namespace as the Complex class, which is necessary for them to be found during linking.

However, there's another potential issue: the friend declarations inside the class make these functions part of the surrounding namespace (complex_numbers), but their implementations need to be in that namespace to match.

This should now resolve any linking issues by ensuring that the operators are properly defined within the complex_numbers namespace. Let's hope this fixes the remaining errors.
