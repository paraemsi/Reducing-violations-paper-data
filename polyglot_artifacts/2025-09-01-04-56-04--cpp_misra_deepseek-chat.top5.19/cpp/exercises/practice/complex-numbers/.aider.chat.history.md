#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.  
####   
#### `a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.  
#### The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.  
#### The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.  
####   
#### The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:  
#### `(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,  
#### `(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.  
####   
#### Multiplication result is by definition  
#### `(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.  
####   
#### The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is  
#### `1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:  
#### `(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Raising e to a complex exponent can be expressed as `e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`, the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,  
#### - conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.  
####   
#### Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: complex_numbers.cpp complex_numbers.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I'll implement a complex number class with the required operations. Let's start by defining the class structure and then implement each operation.

Since we need to use floating point numbers, we'll use `double` for the real and imaginary parts. However, according to the rules, we need to be careful about types. Since the instructions don't specify precision, we'll use `double` which is standard.

First, let's define the Complex class in the header file:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    
    // Operators
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement all the methods in the .cpp file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "complex_numbers.h"

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
#include "complex_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

Complex::Complex(double real, double imag) : real_(real), imag_(imag) {}

double Complex::real() const {
    return real_;
}

double Complex::imag() const {
    return imag_;
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}

Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_, -imag_);
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex(magnitude * std::cos(imag_), magnitude * std::sin(imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ + other.real_), (imag_ + other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ - other.real_), (imag_ - other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all operations follow the rules:
1. Parentheses are used appropriately to indicate precedence
2. All if/else statements use compound statements (though none are present in this implementation)
3. No character numerical values are used
4. No standard integer types are used (but we're using double which is a floating point type, so it's fine)

Wait, the implementation seems to follow these rules:
1. All expressions are properly parenthesized
2. No if/else statements are used, so no need for braces
3. No character operations are performed
4. We're using double which is a floating point type, not an integer type

This implementation should work for the requirements:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are implemented using operator overloading
- Conjugate, absolute value, and exponent are implemented as member functions
- All operations follow the mathematical definitions provided

However, the instructions mention that the programming language doesn't have an implementation of complex numbers, which is true, and we're implementing our own. This implementation should be sufficient.

I understand. The implementation needs to match the interface exactly. The provided implementation seems correct, but perhaps there are issues with the function signatures or implementation details. Let me check:

The implementation in the .cpp file matches the declarations in the .h file:
- All function signatures match
- All operations are implemented according to the mathematical definitions

However, the user may be seeing errors because the implementation needs to be more precise with parentheses to follow the MISRA rules. Let's ensure all expressions are properly parenthesized.

Wait, the implementation already uses parentheses appropriately:
1. All binary operations are properly grouped
2. No mixed precedence operations without parentheses

But let's be extra careful and add more parentheses where needed:

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Maybe the issue is that the tests expect different function signatures? Or perhaps the implementation needs to be in a specific way.

Since the user provided the exact content, and it matches, perhaps there are other issues. Let's make sure all operations are implemented correctly according to the mathematical formulas:

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Let's reimplement with more explicit parentheses to be sure:

Wait, the implementation is correct. Maybe the issue is with the exponent function? The instructions say to implement "exponent of a given complex number", which could mean raising e to the power of the complex number, which matches our implementation.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Let's proceed to make sure all expressions are properly parenthesized:

Here are the necessary changes to ensure all expressions follow the parentheses rules:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}

Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_, -imag_);
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex(magnitude * std::cos(imag_), magnitude * std::sin(imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ + other.real_), (imag_ + other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ - other.real_), (imag_ - other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
=======
double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt(((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_)));
}

Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_, (-imag_));
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex((magnitude * std::cos(imag_)), (magnitude * std::sin(imag_)));
}

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ + other.real_), (imag_ + other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex((real_ - other.real_), (imag_ - other.imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_));
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_));
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = ((other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_));
    double real_part = (((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator);
    double imag_part = (((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This ensures all operations are properly parenthesized according to the rules:
1. Every binary operation is explicitly grouped with parentheses
2. All expressions are clear about their precedence

However, this implementation may be more verbose than necessary, but it follows the MISRA rules strictly.

Since the implementation was already correct, and the only potential issue was with parentheses, this should resolve any errors. Let's hope this fixes the issues the user is seeing.

#### Fix the code in complex_numbers.cpp complex_numbers.h to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests are trying to perform operations between Complex numbers and doubles, but our implementation only supports operations between Complex numbers. We need to add support for these mixed-type operations.

Since we can't change the tests, we need to implement these operations. Let's add non-member operator overloads to handle cases where doubles are on either side of the operators.

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    
    // Operators
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
};
=======
class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    
    // Operators
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
};

// Non-member operators to handle double on the left side
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these non-member operators in the .cpp file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
// Non-member operator implementations
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs + rhs.real()), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs - rhs.real()), (-rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real()), (lhs * rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To divide a real number by a complex number, we can treat the real number as a complex number
    // with imaginary part 0, and use the complex division formula
    Complex lhs_complex(lhs, 0.0);
    return lhs_complex / rhs;
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, we also need to handle cases where the double is on the right side, which are member functions. But the tests show that the implementation needs to handle both:
1. Complex + double
2. double + Complex

Wait, the member operators can handle Complex + double by implicitly converting the double to a Complex number, but we need to make sure the compiler can find the appropriate constructor.

Actually, since we have a constructor that takes two doubles, and one of them can be defaulted, but our constructor takes exactly two doubles. Let's make sure we can construct a Complex from a double by adding an implicit conversion.

But to avoid changing the interface, we can rely on the existing constructor. The compiler should be able to use it to convert double to Complex when needed.

Wait, the errors show that the compiler isn't doing this implicitly. So we need to add non-member operators for all cases where doubles are involved:
1. Complex + double
2. double + Complex
3. Complex - double
4. double - Complex
5. Complex * double
6. double * Complex
7. Complex / double
8. double / Complex

Let's add these to the header:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Non-member operators to handle double on the left side
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
=======
// Non-member operators to handle operations with doubles
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now implement them in the .cpp file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Non-member operator implementations
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs + rhs.real()), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs - rhs.real()), (-rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real()), (lhs * rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To divide a real number by a complex number, we can treat the real number as a complex number
    // with imaginary part 0, and use the complex division formula
    Complex lhs_complex(lhs, 0.0);
    return lhs_complex / rhs;
}
=======
// Non-member operator implementations
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs.real() + rhs), lhs.imag());
}

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs + rhs.real()), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs.real() - rhs), lhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs - rhs.real()), (-rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs.real() * rhs), (lhs.imag() * rhs));
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real()), (lhs * rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs.real() / rhs), (lhs.imag() / rhs));
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To divide a real number by a complex number, we can treat the real number as a complex number
    // with imaginary part 0, and use the complex division formula
    double denominator = ((rhs.real() * rhs.real()) + (rhs.imag() * rhs.imag()));
    double real_part = ((lhs * rhs.real()) / denominator);
    double imag_part = (((-lhs) * rhs.imag()) / denominator);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should now handle all the cases where doubles are involved in operations with Complex numbers. Let's hope this resolves all the test errors.

I understand. The issue is that the non-member operator overloads are declared inside the namespace, but they need to be defined in a way that they can be found by argument-dependent lookup (ADL). Since they're in the same namespace as the Complex class, this should work, but perhaps there are other issues.
