#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a clock that handles times without dates.  
####   
#### You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.  
####   
#### Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.cpp clock.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. Let's implement a clock that handles times without dates, allowing addition and subtraction of minutes, and ensuring that two clocks representing the same time are equal.

Since we need to represent time in hours and minutes, and handle operations that can wrap around days, we'll need to normalize the time to always be within 0-23 hours and 0-59 minutes.

However, the instructions don't specify the exact interface, but typically, we'd need:
1. A Clock class
2. Methods to add and subtract minutes
3. Equality comparison
4. A way to create clocks from hours and minutes

Since the namespace is provided, we'll implement within that.

Let's start by defining the Clock class in the header file.

Here's the plan:
1. The Clock class will store minutes since midnight (0-1439)
2. Provide a constructor that takes hours and minutes
3. Implement add and subtract methods
4. Implement equality operator
5. Implement a toString method to represent the time in "HH:MM" format

Wait, the instructions don't specify the exact methods, but typically:
clock::at(hours, minutes) -> creates a clock
plus(minutes) -> adds minutes
minus(minutes) -> subtracts minutes
operator== to compare

Let's implement:

Here are the necessary changes:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
=======
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

#include <string>
#include <cstdint>

namespace date_independent {
    class clock {
    private:
        std::int32_t minutes_since_midnight;
        clock(std::int32_t minutes);
        
    public:
        static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
        clock plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const;
        clock minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const;
        operator std::string() const;
        bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
        bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;
    };
}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in clock.cpp:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {
    clock::clock(std::int32_t minutes) : minutes_since_midnight(minutes) {
        // Normalize to be within 0-1439
        minutes_since_midnight %= 1440;
        if (minutes_since_midnight < 0) {
            minutes_since_midnight += 1440;
        }
    }
    
    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        return clock(total_minutes);
    }
    
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const {
        return clock(minutes_since_midnight + minutes_to_add);
    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const {
        return clock(minutes_since_midnight - minutes_to_subtract);
    }
    
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = minutes_since_midnight / 60;
        std::int32_t minutes = minutes_since_midnight % 60;
        
        // Normalize hours to be within 0-23
        hours %= 24;
        if (hours < 0) {
            hours += 24;
        }
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << minutes;
        return oss.str();
    }
    
    bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
        return (minutes_since_midnight == other.minutes_since_midnight);
    }
    
    bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
        return !(*this == other);
    }
}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The implementation needs to handle wrapping around days correctly
2. The minutes_since_midnight is always kept within 0-1439 (which is 24*60-1)
3. The toString implementation uses hours and minutes derived from minutes_since_midnight, which is always normalized
4. The plus and minus operations create new clock instances, which will be normalized through the constructor

This implementation should satisfy:
1. Adding and subtracting minutes
2. Equality comparison based on the normalized time
3. Proper formatting to "HH:MM"

However, the instructions don't specify if we need to handle negative hours or minutes in the at() method, but our implementation normalizes everything, so it should work.

Wait, the implementation uses std::int32_t which is a standard signed integer type, but the rules say not to use them. But the rules also say to include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types, which std::int32_t is. So it's okay.

This implementation should work. Let's test the logic:
- When adding or subtracting minutes, it may go beyond a day, but the normalization in the constructor handles that
- The equality is based on the normalized minutes since midnight
- The string representation always shows valid hours and minutes

This seems correct. Let's proceed.

I understand. The issue is that the implementation needs to follow the MISRA C++ rules, which prohibit using standard signed integer types directly. We need to use fixed-width types from <cstdint> instead, which we are already doing. However, the implementation needs to be adjusted to ensure all operations follow the rules.

Wait, the implementation uses std::int32_t which is from <cstdint>, so that's fine. But there are other potential issues:
1. The hours and minutes in the at() method could be negative, which needs to be handled
2. The implementation needs to ensure all operations are appropriate according to the assignment rules

Let's fix the implementation to always normalize the time correctly and follow the rules.

Here are the necessary fixes:

        std::int32_t minutes = minutes_since_midnight % 60;
        
        // Ensure hours is within 0-23 (always true due to normalization)
        // But let's be safe
        hours %= 24;

```

However, there are a few important points:
1. The normalization in the constructor now handles negative values correctly by adding enough full days to make the minutes positive before taking the modulus
2. This ensures minutes_since_midnight is always between 0 and 1439
3. The string conversion always produces valid hours and minutes
4. The implementation uses explicit to prevent implicit conversions
5. The operator!= implementation now directly compares instead of using !operator== to potentially be more efficient

This implementation should now properly handle:
1. Adding and subtracting minutes, even when it crosses day boundaries
2. Negative input values to at()
3. Proper equality comparison
4. Always producing valid time strings in "HH:MM" format

Let's hope this implementation satisfies all requirements and follows the MISRA C++ rules.

I understand. The implementation needs to follow the MISRA C++ rules, which include not using standard signed integer types directly. However, we're already using std::int32_t from <cstdint>, which is allowed. Let's make sure everything else is correct.

Wait, the implementation needs to ensure that all operations are appropriate. Let's fix any potential issues:

1. The normalization in the constructor needs to handle large negative values correctly
2. The string conversion needs to always produce valid hours and minutes

These changes ensure:
1. All assignments are explicit with static_cast where necessary
2. We use const where appropriate
3. All operations are type-safe and follow the rules
4. The implementation remains correct in handling time operations

However, the implementation of the constructor needs to be careful about integer overflow. Since we're using std::int32_t, and the maximum number of minutes we'll handle is 1440 per day, it should be fine within the range of std::int32_t.

This implementation should now be compliant with the provided rules. Let's hope this resolves any issues.
