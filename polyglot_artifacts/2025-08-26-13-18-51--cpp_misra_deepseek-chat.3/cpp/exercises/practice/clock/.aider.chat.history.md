#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a clock that handles times without dates.  
####   
#### You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.  
####   
#### Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.cpp clock.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. We need to implement a clock class that can handle times without dates, support adding and subtracting minutes, and ensure that two clocks representing the same time are considered equal. Let's think through this implementation.

Since we're dealing with times, we can represent the time in minutes since 00:00 (midnight). This makes adding and subtracting minutes straightforward. However, we need to handle wrapping around when minutes go past 1440 (24 hours * 60 minutes) or below 0.

Let's implement a Clock class that stores the total minutes, always normalized to be between 0 and 1439.

Wait, the instructions don't specify the exact interface, but typically, we'd have:
1. A constructor that takes hours and minutes
2. Methods to add and subtract minutes
3. Equality comparison
4. A way to get the time as a string in "HH:MM" format

Since this is C++, we'll need to make sure to follow the MISRA rules, which means using fixed-width integer types.

Here's the plan:
1. Add necessary includes
2. Define a Clock class
3. Implement the required functionality

Here are the necessary changes:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
=======
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

#include <string>
#include <cstdint>

namespace date_independent {

class clock {
private:
    std::int32_t minutes;
    explicit clock(std::int32_t total_minutes);
    
public:
    static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
    clock plus(std::int32_t add_minutes) const;
    clock minus(std::int32_t sub_minutes) const;
    operator std::string() const;
    bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
    bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;
};

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in clock.cpp:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {

clock::clock(std::int32_t total_minutes) {
    // Normalize to be within 0-1439
    total_minutes %= 1440;
    if (total_minutes < 0) {
        total_minutes += 1440;
    }
    this->minutes = total_minutes;
}

clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
    return clock(total_minutes);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t add_minutes) const {
    std::int32_t new_minutes = (this->minutes + add_minutes) % 1440;
    if (new_minutes < 0) {
        new_minutes += 1440;
    }
    return clock(new_minutes);
}

clock clock::minus(std::int32_t sub_minutes) const {
    return this->plus(-sub_minutes);
}

clock::operator std::string() const {
    std::int32_t hours = this->minutes / 60;
    std::int32_t mins = this->minutes % 60;
    
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
        << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
    return oss.str();
}

bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
    return (this->minutes == other.minutes);
}

bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
    return !(*this == other);
}

}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The implementation uses std::int32_t which follows the MISRA rules
2. All operations ensure the minutes stay within valid ranges
3. The plus and minus operations properly handle wrapping around
4. The string conversion uses proper formatting to always show 2 digits
5. We've added equality and inequality operators

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
1. Handle times without dates
2. Add and subtract minutes
3. Two clocks representing the same time are equal (they'll have the same internal minutes value)
4. Follow the provided MISRA rules

However, the implementation may need to be adjusted based on the exact interface expected by the tests. Since the tests aren't provided, we're making assumptions about the interface:
1. Using a static `at` method to create instances
2. `plus` and `minus` methods to add/subtract minutes
3. Conversion to string
4. Equality operators

If the tests expect a different interface, we may need to adjust. Let me know if there are any issues.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle the normalization correctly, especially when dealing with large numbers of minutes. Let's fix that.

The key is to always keep the total minutes within 0-1439 by using modulo arithmetic. However, the modulo operation in C++ can give negative results, so we need to handle that.

Wait, the implementation needs to ensure that when we add or subtract minutes, we always get a valid time. Let's fix the implementation:

Here are the necessary fixes:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
clock::clock(std::int32_t total_minutes) {
    // Normalize to be within 0-1439
    total_minutes %= 1440;
    if (total_minutes < 0) {
        total_minutes += 1440;
    }
    this->minutes = total_minutes;
}

clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
    return clock(total_minutes);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t add_minutes) const {
    std::int32_t new_minutes = (this->minutes + add_minutes) % 1440;
    if (new_minutes < 0) {
        new_minutes += 1440;
    }
    return clock(new_minutes);
}

clock clock::minus(std::int32_t sub_minutes) const {
    return this->plus(-sub_minutes);
}

clock::operator std::string() const {
    std::int32_t hours = this->minutes / 60;
    std::int32_t mins = this->minutes % 60;
    
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
        << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
    return oss.str();
}
=======
clock::clock(std::int32_t total_minutes) {
    // Handle wrapping to always be within [0, 1439]
    // First, compute modulo to get within a day, but adjust for negative values
    std::int32_t mod_minutes = total_minutes % 1440;
    if (mod_minutes < 0) {
        mod_minutes += 1440;
    }
    this->minutes = mod_minutes;
}

clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
    // Convert everything to total minutes first
    std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
    return clock(total_minutes);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t add_minutes) const {
    // Add minutes and normalize
    std::int32_t new_total_minutes = this->minutes + add_minutes;
    return clock(new_total_minutes);
}

clock clock::minus(std::int32_t sub_minutes) const {
    // Subtract minutes and normalize
    std::int32_t new_total_minutes = this->minutes - sub_minutes;
    return clock(new_total_minutes);
}

clock::operator std::string() const {
    std::int32_t hours = this->minutes / 60;
    std::int32_t mins = this->minutes % 60;
    
    // Handle hours wrapping around
    hours %= 24;
    if (hours < 0) hours += 24;
    
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
        << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
    return oss.str();
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue: the hours calculation in the string conversion should always be between 0 and 23. Since minutes is always between 0 and 1439, hours will always be between 0 and 23, so we don't need to adjust hours. Let's fix that:

Wait, if minutes is always between 0 and 1439, then hours will always be between 0 and 23, so we can remove the adjustment:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
clock::operator std::string() const {
    std::int32_t hours = this->minutes / 60;
    std::int32_t mins = this->minutes % 60;
    
    // Handle hours wrapping around
    hours %= 24;
    if (hours < 0) hours += 24;
    
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
        << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
    return oss.str();
}
=======
clock::operator std::string() const {
    std::int32_t hours = this->minutes / 60;
    std::int32_t mins = this->minutes % 60;
    
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
        << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
    return oss.str();
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should now correctly handle:
1. Adding and subtracting minutes, always normalizing to valid times
2. Comparing clocks for equality based on their internal minute values
3. Converting to a string in HH:MM format

Since the minutes are always normalized to be between 0 and 1439, the hours will always be between 0 and 23, which is correct.

This implementation follows the MISRA rules by:
1. Using std::int32_t for all integer values
2. Properly handling operations to prevent overflow issues
3. Ensuring all assignments are between compatible types

Let me know if there are any further issues.
