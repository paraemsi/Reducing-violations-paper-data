#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a fancy store.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value and weight.  
#### Bob would gladly take all of the items, but his knapsack can only hold so much weight.  
#### Bob has to carefully consider which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to determine which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized, taking into account the knapsack's carrying capacity.  
####   
#### Items will be represented as a list of items.  
#### Each item will have a weight and value.  
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10  
#### ```  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.cpp knapsack.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a solution to the classic 0/1 knapsack problem. Since Bob can take each item at most once, and we need to maximize the total value without exceeding the maximum weight, we can use dynamic programming.

However, the implementation needs to be efficient, especially considering the constraints. Since the maximum weight can be up to 1000 or more, and the number of items can be up to 100 or more, we need a solution that's O(n*W) where n is the number of items and W is the maximum weight.

Let's implement this using dynamic programming where dp[i][w] represents the maximum value that can be obtained using the first i items with a maximum weight of w.

Since the implementation needs to be in C++ and follow the given rules, we need to be careful about types and other constraints.

First, let's add the necessary includes and function signatures.

Wait, the files are empty, so we need to add a function to solve the knapsack problem. Let's add a function that takes a list of items and maximum weight, and returns the maximum value.

Here are the necessary changes:

knapsack.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    int weight;
    int value;
};

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
=======
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    std::int32_t weight;
    std::int32_t value;
};

std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items);

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the function in knapsack.cpp:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"

namespace knapsack
{

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty() || (maximumWeight == 0))
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP table where dp[w] will store the maximum value with weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximumWeight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, we process weights in reverse
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; w--)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    std::int32_t maxValue = 0;
    for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximumWeight; w++)
    {
        if (dp[w] > maxValue)
        {
            maxValue = dp[w];
        }
    }
    
    return maxValue;
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. This implementation uses a 1D DP array to save space
2. We process weights in reverse to ensure each item is only used once
3. All values are positive, so we can initialize the DP array with zeros
4. We need to find the maximum value across all weights up to maximumWeight

This implementation should work within the constraints and follows the provided rules:
1. Uses fixed-width integer types
2. No mixing of types
3. Proper parentheses in expressions
4. Compound statements for if/else
5. No character numerical value usage

However, let's test the provided example:
Items: [
  { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },
  { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }
]
Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10

Processing:
1. Item 1: weight 5, value 10
2. Item 2: weight 4, value 40
3. Item 3: weight 6, value 30
4. Item 4: weight 4, value 50

The maximum value should be 90 (items 2 and 4: 40 + 50 = 90, weight 4 + 4 = 8 <= 10)

This implementation should correctly compute this. Let's proceed.

The implementation looks correct, but there are a few potential issues to address:
1. The weight and value types should be consistent with the maximumWeight parameter
2. We need to ensure all operations are between the same types
3. The implementation needs to handle cases where maximumWeight is 0 or items are empty

However, the implementation seems to handle these cases correctly. Let's make sure all types are consistent:
- All weights and values are positive integers
- The maximum weight is a non-negative integer

Since the implementation uses std::int32_t, which matches the function signature, it should be fine.

Wait, the implementation uses:
std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; w--
But item.weight is also std::int32_t, which matches, so it's fine.

However, to be precise, we need to ensure that when maximumWeight is 0, we return 0, which is handled.

Let's run through the implementation:
1. If items are empty or maximumWeight is 0, return 0
2. Initialize a DP array with size maximumWeight + 1, all zeros
3. For each item, update the DP array from maximumWeight down to the item's weight
4. Find the maximum value in the DP array

This seems correct. Let's test with the provided example:
maximumWeight = 10
Items: weights [5,4,6,4], values [10,40,30,50]

Processing:
1. Item 1: weight=5, value=10
   Update w=10 to max(0, 0+10)=10
   Update w=9 to max(0, 0+10)=10
   ... up to w=5
   dp becomes: [0,0,0,0,0,10,10,10,10,10,10]

2. Item 2: weight=4, value=40
   Update w=10 to max(10, dp[6]+40=0+40=40) -> 40
   Update w=9 to max(10, dp[5]+40=10+40=50) -> 50
   Update w=8 to max(10, dp[4]+40=0+40=40) -> 40
   Update w=7 to max(10, dp[3]+40=0+40=40) -> 40
   Update w=6 to max(10, dp[2]+40=0+40=40) -> 40
   Update w=5 to max(10, dp[1]+40=0+40=40) -> 40
   Update w=4 to max(0, dp[0]+40=0+40=40) -> 40
   dp becomes: [0,0,0,0,40,40,40,40,40,50,40]

3. Item 3: weight=6, value=30
   Update w=10 to max(40, dp[4]+30=40+30=70) -> 70
   Update w=9 to max(50, dp[3]+30=0+30=30) -> 50
   Update w=8 to max(40, dp[2]+30=0+30=30) -> 40
   Update w=7 to max(40, dp[1]+30=0+30=30) -> 40
   Update w=6 to max(40, dp[0]+30=0+30=30) -> 40
   dp becomes: [0,0,0,0,40,40,40,40,40,50,70]

4. Item 4: weight=4, value=50
   Update w=10 to max(70, dp[6]+50=40+50=90) -> 90
   Update w=9 to max(50, dp[5]+50=40+50=90) -> 90
   Update w=8 to max(40, dp[4]+50=40+50=90) -> 90
   Update w=7 to max(40, dp[3]+50=0+50=50) -> 50
   Update w=6 to max(40, dp[2]+50=0+50=50) -> 50
   Update w=5 to max(40, dp[1]+50=0+50=50) -> 50
   Update w=4 to max(40, dp[0]+50=0+50=50) -> 50
   dp becomes: [0,0,0,0,50,50,50,50,90,90,90]

The maximum value in dp is 90, which matches the expected result.

The implementation seems correct. Let's make sure it follows all the rules:
1. All types are fixed-width integers
2. No mixing of types
3. Proper parentheses in expressions
4. Compound statements for if/else
5. No character numerical value usage

Wait, the condition in the if statement:
if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
This uses parentheses appropriately.

Since the implementation seems correct, and the types match, there may be no errors to fix.
But to be thorough, let's add some braces to ensure all if/else statements are compound statements.

Wait, there's only one if statement, and it already uses braces:
```cpp
if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
{
    dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
}
```

This is correct.

Since the implementation seems correct, and the user says to fix errors if possible, but no errors are apparent, perhaps the implementation is correct as is.

However, to ensure maximumValue can handle cases where maximumWeight is very large, but since it's an int32_t, which can be up to ~2 billion, and we're creating a vector of that size, it may be too memory intensive. But the problem doesn't specify constraints, so we'll assume it's within reasonable limits.

Since the implementation seems correct, I'll leave it as is.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in knapsack.cpp knapsack.h to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests are expecting a function named `maximum_value`, but our implementation has `maximumValue`. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

knapsack.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items);
=======
std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
=======
std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This should resolve the compilation errors by matching the function name that the tests are expecting. Let's hope this fixes the issues.

The implementation looks correct, but let's make sure it handles all edge cases properly. The implementation seems to be working, but let's test it with the provided example:

Items: [
  { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },
  { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }
]
Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10

The maximum value should be 90, which matches our implementation's result.

However, to ensure it's robust, let's add some additional checks:
1. Make sure we don't access negative indices
2. Handle cases where item weights are greater than maximumWeight

Wait, the loop condition `w >= item.weight` ensures we never access negative indices, which is good.

Since the implementation seems correct, and the types match, there may be no errors to fix. But to be thorough, let's add some optimizations and ensure all rules are followed:

1. Always use compound statements for if/else
2. Use parentheses to ensure proper precedence
3. No mixing of types

Wait, the implementation already follows these rules:
1. All if statements use braces
2. Parentheses are used appropriately in expressions
3. All types are consistent (std::int32_t)

Since the implementation seems correct, and the user says to fix errors if possible, but no errors are apparent, perhaps the implementation is correct as is.

However, to make sure it's efficient, we can note that finding the maximum value at the end is not necessary because the maximum value will always be at dp[maximumWeight] in a standard implementation. But this may not always be true if we can't fill the knapsack completely, so our approach of finding the maximum is correct.

Wait, in the standard implementation, we always fill up to maximumWeight, and the maximum value may be at a weight less than maximumWeight if items don't exactly fill the knapsack. So our approach is correct.

Since the implementation seems correct, I'll leave it as is. If there are specific errors, please provide more details.
