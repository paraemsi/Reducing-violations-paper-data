#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a clock that handles times without dates.  
####   
#### You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.  
####   
#### Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.cpp clock.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. Let's implement a clock that handles times without dates, allowing addition and subtraction of minutes, and ensuring that two clocks representing the same time are equal.

Since we need to use fixed-width integer types, we'll include <cstdint>.
The implementation will likely need to represent time in minutes and normalize it to be within 0-1439 (24 hours * 60 minutes per day).

Let's think about the implementation:
1. We need a Clock class that can be constructed with hours and minutes
2. We need to be able to add and subtract minutes
3. We need to implement equality
4. We need to format the time as "HH:MM"

Since the namespace is date_independent, we'll put our implementation there.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a Clock class to clock.h
2. Implement the class in clock.cpp
3. Make sure to handle wrapping around days when adding/subtracting minutes
4. Implement operators for equality, addition, and subtraction

Wait, the instructions don't specify the exact interface, but typically, we'd have:
- A constructor that takes hours and minutes
- plus() and minus() methods to add/subtract minutes
- operator== to compare
- toString() to format the time

However, the tests may expect specific function signatures. Let's implement a common approach.

Here are the necessary changes:

First, let's update clock.h:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
=======
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

namespace date_independent {
    class clock {
    private:
        std::int32_t total_minutes;
        clock(std::int32_t minutes);
    public:
        static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
        clock plus(std::int32_t minutes) const;
        clock minus(std::int32_t minutes) const;
        operator std::string() const;
        bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
        bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;
    };
}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the class in clock.cpp:

clock.cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {
    clock::clock(std::int32_t minutes) : total_minutes(minutes) {}
    
    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        // Normalize to be within 0-1439 minutes
        std::int32_t total = (hours * 60 + minutes) % 1440;
        if (total < 0) {
            total += 1440;
        }
        return clock(total);
    }
    
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        return clock::at(0, total_minutes + minutes);
    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        return clock::at(0, total_minutes - minutes);
    }
    
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = (total_minutes / 60) % 24;
        std::int32_t mins = total_minutes % 60;
        if (hours < 0) {
            hours += 24;
        }
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
        return oss.str();
    }
    
    bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
        return total_minutes == other.total_minutes;
    }
    
    bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
        return !(*this == other);
    }
}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The implementation uses std::int32_t which is a fixed-width type
2. We always normalize the time to be within 0-1439 minutes
3. The plus and minus operations create new clock instances
4. The toString() is implemented via the string conversion operator
5. We've added operator!= for completeness

This implementation should handle:
- Adding and subtracting minutes, wrapping around days
- Comparing clocks for equality
- Formatting the time as "HH:MM"

However, the implementation needs to be careful about negative values when normalizing. The modulo operation in C++ can produce negative results, so we adjust by adding 1440 if necessary to always get a positive value within 0-1439.

This implementation should work, but let's test some cases:
1. Creating a clock at 10:30
2. Adding 30 minutes to get 11:00
3. Subtracting 60 minutes from 10:30 to get 9:30
4. Handling midnight (0:00) correctly
5. Wrapping around days (e.g., adding 1440 minutes should give the same time)

Wait, the implementation of plus and minus uses at(0, total_minutes ± minutes), which will properly normalize the result. This is correct.

This implementation should meet the requirements. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle the normalization correctly and to ensure all operations work as expected. Let's fix the implementation.

However, there's an important point: the total_minutes can be negative, which needs to be handled properly when converting to hours and minutes. Let's ensure all operations normalize the time correctly.

Wait, the implementation of at() should always produce a valid time between 0 and 1439 minutes. So when we add or subtract, we need to make sure to normalize the result.

Here are the necessary fixes:

1. The implementation of operator std::string() can be simplified since total_minutes is always between 0 and 1439
2. Let's fix the normalization to always produce a positive value between 0 and 1439

Here are the changes:

clock.cpp

        // Normalize to be within 0-1439 minutes
        std::int32_t total = (hours * 60 + minutes) % 1440;
        if (total < 0) {
            total += 1440;

        if (total_minutes < 0) {

    }
    
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        // Since total_minutes is always between 0 and 1439, we can safely compute hours and minutes
        std::int32_t hours = total_minutes / 60;

    bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
        return total_minutes != other.total_minutes;
    }
}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue with large values when adding or subtracting minutes. The implementation uses modulo arithmetic which should handle this correctly, but let's test:
- Adding a very large number of minutes (more than a day)
- Subtracting a very large number of minutes

The implementation should work because:
1. We're using modulo 1440 (number of minutes in a day)
2. We always adjust negative results to be positive by adding 1440

This ensures that the time always stays within the valid range of 0 to 1439 minutes, which represents times from 00:00 to 23:59.

Also, the implementation of operator std::string() now always has total_minutes between 0 and 1439, so hours will always be between 0 and 23, and minutes between 0 and 59. This is correct.

This implementation should now handle all cases correctly:
1. Creating clocks with valid and invalid times (they'll be normalized)
2. Adding and subtracting minutes, including across day boundaries
3. Comparing clocks for equality based on their normalized time
4. Formatting the time as a string in HH:MM format

Let's hope this fixes any issues!
