#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a clock that handles times without dates.  
####   
#### You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.  
####   
#### Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.h clock.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. Let's implement a clock that handles times without dates, allowing addition and subtraction of minutes, and ensuring that two clocks representing the same time are equal.

Since we need to use fixed-width integer types, we'll include <cstdint>. We'll represent the time in minutes since 00:00, which makes it easy to add and subtract minutes, and then normalize to a 24-hour period (1440 minutes).

However, the instructions don't specify the interface, but typically, we'd need:
1. A Clock class
2. Constructors to create a clock at a specific hour and minute
3. Methods to add and subtract minutes
4. Equality comparison
5. A way to represent the time as a string

Since the namespace is date_independent, we'll put everything inside that.

Let's implement this:

Here are the necessary changes:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
=======
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

#include <string>
#include <cstdint>

namespace date_independent {
    class clock {
    private:
        std::int32_t minutes;
        clock(std::int32_t total_minutes);
        
    public:
        static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
        clock plus(std::int32_t add_minutes) const;
        clock minus(std::int32_t sub_minutes) const;
        operator std::string() const;
        bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
        bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;
    };
}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation in clock.cpp:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {
    clock::clock(std::int32_t total_minutes) {
        // Normalize to be within 0-1439 (minutes in a day)
        // Handle negative values by adding enough days to make it positive
        total_minutes %= 1440;
        if (total_minutes < 0) {
            total_minutes += 1440;
        }
        this->minutes = total_minutes;
    }
    
    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        return clock(total_minutes);
    }
    
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t add_minutes) const {
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (this->minutes + add_minutes) % 1440;
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t sub_minutes) const {
        return this->plus(-sub_minutes);
    }
    
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = (this->minutes / 60) % 24;
        std::int32_t mins = this->minutes % 60;
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
        return oss.str();
    }
    
    bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
        return (this->minutes == other.minutes);
    }
    
    bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
        return !(*this == other);
    }
}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The plus and minus operations need to handle wrapping around days correctly
2. We need to ensure that the time is always normalized to be within 00:00 to 23:59
3. The implementation uses modulo arithmetic to handle wrapping
4. The implementation ensures that negative times are adjusted to positive by adding enough days

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
1. Add and subtract minutes
2. Two clocks representing the same time are equal (their internal minute counts match)
3. Times are handled without dates

However, the implementation uses a private constructor which is accessed through the static `at` method to create clock instances. This ensures that all clock instances are always in a valid state.

Let's test the implementation:
- clock::at(8, 0) should create a clock at 08:00
- Adding minutes should work: clock::at(10, 0).plus(3) -> 10:03
- Subtracting minutes should work: clock::at(10, 3).minus(3) -> 10:00
- Times should wrap around: clock::at(23, 59).plus(2) -> 00:01
- Equality should be based on the time: clock::at(15, 37) == clock::at(15, 37) -> true

This implementation should handle all these cases correctly.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle large numbers of minutes correctly, especially when adding or subtracting. The current implementation may not handle very large values correctly due to potential integer overflow issues.

However, since we're using fixed-width integers, and the number of minutes in a day is 1440, we can always normalize the total minutes to be within 0-1439. Let's fix the implementation to ensure it always handles large numbers correctly.

The key is to always normalize the total minutes to be within 0-1439 by using modulo 1440, and handle negative values properly.

Here are the necessary fixes:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {
    clock::clock(std::int32_t total_minutes) {
        // Normalize to be within 0-1439 (minutes in a day)
        // Handle negative values by adding enough days to make it positive
        total_minutes %= 1440;
        if (total_minutes < 0) {
            total_minutes += 1440;
        }
        this->minutes = total_minutes;
    }
    
    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        return clock(total_minutes);
    }
    
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t add_minutes) const {
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (this->minutes + add_minutes) % 1440;
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t sub_minutes) const {
        return this->plus(-sub_minutes);
    }
    
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = (this->minutes / 60) % 24;
        std::int32_t mins = this->minutes % 60;
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
        return oss.str();
    }

    }

        // Handle negative values by adding enough days to make it positive
        // To avoid integer overflow issues, we use modulo arithmetic
        total_minutes %= 1440;
        if (total_minutes < 0) {
            total_minutes += 1440;
        }
        minutes = total_minutes;
    }

        // Add minutes and normalize
        // To prevent integer overflow, we can compute modulo 1440 at each step
        // Since minutes is always between 0-1439, adding add_minutes could be large
        // Let's compute the new total minutes modulo 1440
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (minutes + add_minutes) % 1440;
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += 1440;

    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t sub_minutes) const {
        // Subtract minutes is the same as adding negative minutes
        return plus(-sub_minutes);
    }
    
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = minutes / 60;
        std::int32_t mins = minutes % 60;

        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
        return oss.str();
    }
    
    bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
        return (minutes == other.minutes);
    }
    
    bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
        return (minutes != other.minutes);
    }
}  // namespace date_independent

```

However, there's a potential issue when computing total_minutes in the `at` method. If hours and minutes are very large, their product could overflow a 32-bit integer. But since we're using std::int32_t, and the maximum value is 2,147,483,647, which is much larger than 1440 * 60 * 24, it should be fine for reasonable inputs.

Wait, 1440 minutes per day, which is 1440 * 60 * 24 = 2,073,600 which fits in std::int32_t.

This implementation should now handle:
1. Adding and subtracting large numbers of minutes correctly by always normalizing
2. Ensuring times are always valid (between 00:00 and 23:59)
3. Proper equality comparison
4. String representation in HH:MM format

Let's test some edge cases:
1. Adding more than a day's worth of minutes: clock::at(0, 0).plus(1440) should equal clock::at(0, 0)
2. Subtracting more than a day's worth of minutes: clock::at(0, 0).minus(1440) should equal clock::at(0, 0)
3. Negative hours or minutes in the at() method: The implementation normalizes them correctly

This implementation should now be robust and meet all requirements.
