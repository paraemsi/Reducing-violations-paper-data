#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of [perfect](#perfect), [abundant](#abundant), or [deficient](#deficient) based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The _aliquot sum_ is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of `15` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.  
####   
#### ## Perfect  
####   
#### A number is perfect when it equals its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `6` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`  
#### - `28` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`  
####   
#### ## Abundant  
####   
#### A number is abundant when it is less than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `12` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
#### - `24` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36`  
####   
#### ## Deficient  
####   
#### A number is deficient when it is greater than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `8` is a deficient number because `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`  
#### - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is [perfect](#perfect).  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is [abundant](#abundant) or [deficient](#deficient).

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: perfect_numbers.h perfect_numbers.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not use the keywords signed/unsigned char, short, int, long, or long long (and their unsigned forms) for variables, parameters, or return types.    
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types such as std::int8_t, std::uint16_t, std::int32_t, std::uint64_t, or project-specific typedefs/aliases that wrap them.    
#### - int is permitted only for the main() return type, its parameters (argc, argv), and as the dummy int in postfix ++/-- operators; avoid it elsewhere.    
#### - Typedef/using declarations that create aliases are allowed and encouraged for readability.    
#### - Plain char is covered by another rule; avoid it for integers.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Parenthesize every sub-expression that combines binary or ternary operators with different precedence levels ( *, /, %, +, -, <<, >>, <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, &, ^, |, &&, ||, ?: ).    
#### - Omit parentheses only when adjacent operators share the exact same precedence and associativity (e.g. `a + b - c`, `x & y ^ z`).    
#### - Unary operators may remain unparenthesized when used inside a larger expression (`a * -b` is OK).    
#### - Never rely on default precedence in conditions, assignments, returns, or initializers; make evaluation order explicit: `if ((a == 1) && (b > 0))`, `val = a * (b + 1);`.    
#### - Treat overloaded operators with the same caution; add parentheses for clarity even if the rule does not mandate it.    
#### - Example pitfalls: avoid `a * b + 1`, `if (a + b != c - d)`, `if (x == 0 && y > 1)`; rewrite with parentheses.  
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep numeric assignments strictly safe: identical type category, signedness and size, or an allowed widening/constant case    
#### - OK: same category & signedness, destination wider, source is a single variable (id-expression) ‒ e.g. `uint32_t big = small8;`    
#### - OK: floating-point constant → wider floating type ‒ e.g. `long double ld = 1.0f;`    
#### - OK: integer constant/constant expression → any numeric type (or bit-field) whose range can hold the value ‒ e.g. `float f = 42;`, `uint8_t u = 255;`    
#### - Otherwise: do NOT assign, initialise, pass by value, return, or use in a `case` label    
####   • No wider→narrower size (e.g. `uint8_t u = uint32_t_val;`)    
####   • No signed↔unsigned change (e.g. `uint32_t = int32_t;`)    
####   • No integer↔floating conversion except the constant cases above    
####   • No value that exceeds target range    
#### - For widening, use a variable, not an arithmetic expression; if you must convert, use an explicit cast that yields a compliant source type first    
#### - Apply the same checks in constructors, default arguments, lambda captures, operator calls, etc. ‒ every by-value transfer counts as an assignment    
#### - Treat unscoped enums as their underlying integral type when checking these rules  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Never convert character types (‘char’, ‘signed/unsigned char’, ‘wchar_t’, ‘char16_t’, ‘char32_t’) to or from any non-character arithmetic type (int, bool, enum, float, …); forbid both implicit assignments and casts.    
#### - Do not perform arithmetic, bitwise, relational (<, >, <=, >=), or ++/-- on character objects; only == and != between identical character types are allowed.    
#### - Initialise/assign character variables exclusively with character literals of the same category (e.g., char c = '\n'; wchar_t w = L'x';), not numeric constants.    
#### - When an integer representation is unavoidable, use library helpers such as std::char_traits<CharT>::to_int_type(), never rely on direct conversion.    
#### - Use <cctype>/<cwctype> utilities (std::isalpha, std::tolower, …) instead of numeric range checks on characters.    
#### - Raw byte or small-integer data should be held in std::byte, std::uint8_t, or int8_t, not in char-family types.    
#### - Unevaluated operands (sizeof, decltype, alignof) and casts to void of a function call returning a character are permissible.  
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always wrap the body of every `if` in `{ … }`, even if it is a single statement    
#### - Always wrap the body of every `else` in `{ … }`; braces may be omitted only when the `else` is immediately followed by another `if` (`else if`)    
#### - Do not place any non-braced statement directly after `if (…)` or `else`    
#### - Never write `if (condition);` — replace with a braced empty block or remove the statement    
#### - Keep braces and indentation consistent so the controlled block is visually unambiguous  
####   
#### The numeric value of an unscoped enumeration with no fixed underlying type shall not be used  
#### - Declare enums as `enum class` or give them an explicit underlying type (e.g. `enum Mode : std::uint8_t`); avoid plain `enum Mode { … };`.  
#### - For an unscoped enum without a fixed underlying type:  
####   • Do NOT use it with any arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or compound-assignment operator.    
####   • Only compare it (`==, !=, <, >, <=, >=`) with another value of the same enum type.    
####   • In `switch (e)`, every `case` label must be an enumerator of that same enum.    
####   • Only assign/initialize/return/pass it to the same enum type; if an integral value is required, first cast to an integer type wide enough to hold every enumerator.    
####   • `static_cast` is permitted only to a sufficiently wide integer type; never cast to another enum or to a too-narrow integer.    
#### - If you need numeric manipulation, either cast the value to a wide integer first or redesign the enum as `enum class` / fixed-width to remove the restriction.  
#### </rules>

Hello! As an expert software developer, I'd be happy to help you with your request. Here are the changes to implement the perfect number classification logic.

I will update `perfect_numbers.h` to declare an `enum class` for the classification types and a `classify` function. Then I'll implement the `classify` function in `perfect_numbers.cpp`. This function will calculate the aliquot sum of a given number and determine if it's perfect, abundant, or deficient.

Here are the required changes:

```cpp
perfect_numbers.h
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int32_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```cpp
perfect_numbers.cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int32_t number) {
    if (number < 1) {
        throw std::domain_error("Classification is only for positive integers.");
    }

    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }

    std::int32_t aliquot_sum = 1;
    for (std::int32_t i = 2; i <= (number / i); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            aliquot_sum += i;
            const std::int32_t d = number / i;
            if (d != i) {
                aliquot_sum += d;
            }
        }
    }

    if (aliquot_sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (aliquot_sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Based on the information you provided, it seems like your linter or static analysis tool might prefer a more idiomatic C++ include guard syntax. While `#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)` is perfectly valid, `#ifndef PERFECT_NUMBERS_H` is more common and often preferred for clarity.

I will make this change to `perfect_numbers.h`. The other highlighted lines appear to be correct and may be flagged as a result of the non-standard include guard syntax.

Here is the change:

```cpp
perfect_numbers.h
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
=======
#ifndef PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

It appears you are still seeing errors from a static analysis tool. While the current code is valid C++, some tools have very specific style preferences. The most common one for header files is using `#pragma once` instead of traditional include guards. This change might resolve all the reported issues, as the others could be cascading errors from the tool not recognizing the include guard style it prefers.

I will update `perfect_numbers.h` to use `#pragma once`.

Here are the changes:

```cpp
perfect_numbers.h
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#ifndef PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#pragma once
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```cpp
perfect_numbers.h
<<<<<<< SEARCH
}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Based on the errors your tooling is reporting, it seems it is enforcing a strict rule that `enum class` declarations must have an explicit underlying type. While not required by the C++ standard itself, this is a common rule in safety-critical coding standards like MISRA to ensure predictable size and layout for enumerations.

I will add an explicit underlying type of `std::uint8_t` to the `classification` enum, which should be sufficient to hold its values and resolve these errors.

Here is the change for `perfect_numbers.h`:

```cpp
perfect_numbers.h
<<<<<<< SEARCH
enum class classification {
=======
enum class classification : std::uint8_t {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
