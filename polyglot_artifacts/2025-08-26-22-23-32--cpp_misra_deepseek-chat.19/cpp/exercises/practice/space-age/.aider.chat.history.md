#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: space_age.cpp space_age.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a class that can calculate someone's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

First, we need to define a class in the space_age namespace that can store the age in seconds and provide methods to calculate the age on each planet. Since the orbital periods are given relative to Earth years, we can compute the Earth age first and then divide by each planet's orbital period.

Since we're dealing with floating point numbers, we need to be precise. Let's use double precision floating point numbers.

Wait, the instructions say to use fixed-width integer types, but for floating point numbers, we can use double directly.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a constructor that takes an integer number of seconds
2. Add methods for each planet to calculate the age
3. The Earth age in years is: seconds / 31557600.0
4. For other planets, divide the Earth age by their orbital period

However, the instructions say not to change existing functions or classes, but the namespace seems empty. So we need to add a class definition.

Let's implement:

Wait, the files are empty, so we need to add everything from scratch.

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    std::int64_t age_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(std::int64_t seconds);
    std::int64_t seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in space_age.cpp:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"
#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(std::int64_t seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

std::int64_t space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all operations follow the rules:
1. We're using std::int64_t which is appropriate
2. We're casting age_seconds to double to perform floating point division
3. All operations are parenthesized correctly

Wait, the rules say to always parenthesize binary operations when they're operands of other operators. Let's check:
(static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) is a binary operation, and then we divide by another number
This is correct because we're using parentheses to ensure the order of operations

This implementation should work. Let's test the example:
1,000,000,000 seconds should be 31.69 Earth years
Which matches: 1,000,000,000 / 31,557,600 ≈ 31.688

Wait, the note says 31,557,600 seconds per Earth year, which matches our implementation.

This implementation should be correct. Let's proceed.

I understand. The issue is that the class name and the namespace have the same name, which can be confusing. But according to the instructions, we shouldn't change the names of existing functions or classes. So the class name must remain `space_age` within the `space_age` namespace.

However, the implementation seems correct. Let's make sure all the method signatures match. The implementation needs to be precise, and we need to follow the rules about parentheses.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Let's ensure all floating point constants are precise and use appropriate parentheses.

Actually, to make sure all operations are properly parenthesized, let's be explicit:
1. Always put parentheses around divisions
2. Make sure the order of operations is clear

But the implementation already does this. Let's see:

Wait, the implementation uses:
(static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / orbital_period
This is correct because it first divides by 31557600.0, then by the orbital period

But to be extra precise, we can use:
static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / (31557600.0 * orbital_period)
This might be more efficient and precise

Let's update the implementation:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 164.79132;
}
=======
double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / (31557600.0 * 0.2408467);
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / (31557600.0 * 0.61519726);
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / (31557600.0 * 1.8808158);
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / (31557600.0 * 11.862615);
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / (31557600.0 * 29.447498);
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / (31557600.0 * 84.016846);
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / (31557600.0 * 164.79132);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation is more precise because it does one division operation instead of two, which can reduce floating point errors. It also follows the rules by using parentheses appropriately.

However, the implementation for on_earth() remains the same, which is correct.

This should now be compliant with the requirements. Let's test the numbers:
For 1,000,000,000 seconds on Earth: 1,000,000,000 / 31,557,600 ≈ 31.688
Which matches the example provided.

This implementation should now be correct and follow all the rules.
