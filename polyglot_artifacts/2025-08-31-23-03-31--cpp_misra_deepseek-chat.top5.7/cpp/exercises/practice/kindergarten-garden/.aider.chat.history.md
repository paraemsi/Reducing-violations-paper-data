#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The kindergarten class is learning about growing plants.  
#### The teacher thought it would be a good idea to give the class seeds to plant and grow in the dirt.  
#### To this end, the children have put little cups along the window sills and planted one type of plant in each cup.  
#### The children got to pick their favorites from four available types of seeds: grass, clover, radishes, and violets.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to, given a diagram, determine which plants each child in the kindergarten class is responsible for.  
####   
#### There are 12 children in the class:  
####   
#### - Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve, Fred, Ginny, Harriet, Ileana, Joseph, Kincaid, and Larry.  
####   
#### Four different types of seeds are planted:  
####   
#### | Plant  | Diagram encoding |  
#### | ------ | ---------------- |  
#### | Grass  | G                |  
#### | Clover | C                |  
#### | Radish | R                |  
#### | Violet | V                |  
####   
#### Each child gets four cups, two on each row:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### ........................ # each dot represents a cup  
#### ........................  
#### ```  
####   
#### Their teacher assigns cups to the children alphabetically by their names, which means that Alice comes first and Larry comes last.  
####   
#### Here is an example diagram representing Alice's plants:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VR......................  
#### RG......................  
#### ```  
####   
#### In the first row, nearest the windows, she has a violet and a radish.  
#### In the second row she has a radish and some grass.  
####   
#### Your program will be given the plants from left-to-right starting with the row nearest the windows.  
#### From this, it should be able to determine which plants belong to each student.  
####   
#### For example, if it's told that the garden looks like so:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV  
#### VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then if asked for Alice's plants, it should provide:  
####   
#### - Violets, radishes, violets, radishes  
####   
#### While asking for Bob's plants would yield:  
####   
#### - Clover, grass, clover, clover  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: kindergarten_garden.cpp kindergarten_garden.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a function that, given a diagram of plants, can determine which plants belong to each child. The children are always in a fixed order, and each child gets two plants from each row, with their plants being assigned in order from left to right.

Since the number of children is fixed (12), and their names are fixed, we can use a list of names to index into the plants.
Each child gets 4 plants: first two from the first row, next two from the second row.

Let's implement a function that takes a diagram (probably a string) and a child's name, and returns their plants.
But the instructions aren't clear about the exact function signature, so we'll need to make assumptions.

Wait, the files provided are empty, so we need to define the interface.
Typically, we'd have a class or function that can be used to get plants for a child.

Let's implement a function `plants` that takes the diagram and the child's name, and returns a vector of plant names.

However, the diagram is provided as two lines, so we need to split it into two rows.
Each child gets two plants from each row, and the plants are assigned in order to children alphabetically.

Since there are 12 children, and each gets 2 plants per row, each row must have 24 plants.
Wait, the example shows:
"VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV" which is 24 characters
"VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV" which is also 24 characters

So each child's index can be used to find their plants:
child index * 2 and child index * 2 + 1 in each row

First, let's define the list of children in order.
Then, for a given child, find their index, and get the appropriate plants from both rows.

Here's the implementation plan:
1. Split the diagram into two rows
2. Find the index of the child in the ordered list
3. For each row, get the two plants at positions index*2 and index*2 +1
4. Convert the characters to plant names

Let's implement:

Here are the necessary changes:

std::vector<std::string> plants(const std::string& diagram, const std::string& student) {
    // List of children in order
    const std::array<std::string, 12> children = {
        "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David",
        "Eve", "Fred", "Ginny", "Harriet",
        "Ileana", "Joseph", "Kincaid", "Larry"
    };
    
    // Find the index of the student
    int index = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
        if (children[i] == student) {
            index = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // Split the diagram into two rows
    std::istringstream iss(diagram);
    std::string row1, row2;
    std::getline(iss, row1);
    std::getline(iss, row2);
    
    // Get the plants for the child
    std::vector<std::string> result;
    
    // First row plants
    char plant1 = row1[index * 2];
    char plant2 = row1[index * 2 + 1];
    // Second row plants
    char plant3 = row2[index * 2];
    char plant4 = row2[index * 2 + 1];
    
    // Helper function to convert char to plant name
    auto convertPlant = [](char c) -> std::string {
        switch (c) {
            case 'G': return "grass";
            case 'C': return "clover";
            case 'R': return "radishes";
            case 'V': return "violets";
            default: return "";
        }
    };
    
    result.push_back(convertPlant(plant1));
    result.push_back(convertPlant(plant2));
    result.push_back(convertPlant(plant3));
    result.push_back(convertPlant(plant4));
    
    return result;
}

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The diagram may be provided with newlines, which we split using string stream
2. We need to find the index of the child in the ordered list
3. We need to convert each character to the corresponding plant name

This implementation should work according to the instructions. Let's test it with the provided examples:
- Alice's plants: index 0 -> positions 0 and 1 in each row
- Bob's plants: index 1 -> positions 2 and 3 in each row

Wait, the example says:
Alice: Violets, radishes, violets, radishes
Which would be from the first two characters of each row:
First row: 'V', 'R' -> Violets, radishes
Second row: 'R', 'G' -> But the example says violets, radishes? Wait, there must be a mistake in the initial explanation.

Actually, the initial example may be different from the text explanation.
But according to the implementation, it should work with the provided example:
"VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV\nVRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV"

Wait, the implementation uses index*2 and index*2 +1 which for Alice (index 0) would be positions 0 and 1
Which matches:
First row: 'V', 'R' -> Violets, radishes
Second row: 'V', 'R' -> Violets, radishes
Which matches the example: Violets, radishes, violets, radishes

This seems correct. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to follow the MISRA C++ rules. Let's fix the issues:

1. Don't use 'int' directly, use fixed-width types
2. Ensure proper handling of characters without using their numerical values
3. Add necessary includes
4. Follow other rules like always using braces for if statements

```

This implementation follows the MISRA C++ rules:
1. Uses fixed-width integer types (std::int32_t)
2. Avoids using numerical values of characters by using direct equality comparisons
3. Always uses braces for control structures
4. Uses appropriate includes

However, there's a potential issue: the index could be -1 if the student name isn't found. But according to the problem, the children are always from the fixed list, so this should never happen. If it's a concern, we could add a check, but the instructions don't specify how to handle invalid names.

This implementation should now be compliant with the provided rules. Let me know if you need any further adjustments.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle cases where the diagram may not be split into two lines correctly. Let's fix that and ensure all MISRA C++ rules are followed.

The main issue is that the diagram may be provided as a single string with a newline, but we need to split it into two rows properly. Let's also make sure to handle the index correctly.

Here are the necessary fixes:

```

This implementation:
1. Uses `find` to locate the newline instead of string streams, which may be more reliable
2. Ensures all if statements have braces
3. Uses proper integer types
4. Avoids using numerical values of characters by only using equality comparisons
5. Properly indexes into the rows to get each child's plants

However, there's a nested if-else structure to avoid using switch, which may be treated as using numerical values of characters. This is a bit verbose but follows the rules.

This should now handle the diagram correctly by splitting it into two rows and finding the appropriate plants for the given student. Let me know if you encounter any issues.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in kindergarten_garden.cpp kindergarten_garden.h to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests expect an enum type `Plants` to be used, but our implementation returns a vector of strings. Let's fix that by defining the `Plants` enum and adjusting our implementation accordingly.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Uses the `Plants` enum as expected by the tests
2. Returns a vector of `Plants` instead of strings
3. Converts the plant codes to the appropriate enum values
4. Maintains the same logic for finding the child's plants

This should now match what the tests expect. Let's hope this resolves the compilation errors.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to match the test expectations. The tests seem to expect the plants to be in a specific order, and there might be an issue with the enum ordering. Let's make sure the implementation matches what the tests expect.

However, the implementation looks correct. Let's ensure that the plants are being added in the correct order: first row left, first row right, second row left, second row right.

Wait, the tests might be expecting the plants to be ordered differently. Let's make sure:
1. The plants are always added in the correct order
2. The enum values match the test expectations

Since the tests are correct, and we can't change them, we need to make sure our implementation matches. Let's see:

The implementation looks correct, but perhaps the enum order needs to match the test's expectations. The tests might be using integer values that don't match our enum ordering.

Wait, the tests are using enum values directly, so the order in the enum declaration matters. Let's make sure it matches:
clover, grass, radishes, violets

This seems correct. Let's run with this implementation.

However, to be thorough, let's make sure we're always using the correct indices:
Each child gets two plants from each row, and their index determines which plants they get.

Wait, the implementation uses index * 2 and index * 2 + 1 which seems correct.

Let's proceed with this implementation. If there are still issues, we'll need to see more specific error messages.
