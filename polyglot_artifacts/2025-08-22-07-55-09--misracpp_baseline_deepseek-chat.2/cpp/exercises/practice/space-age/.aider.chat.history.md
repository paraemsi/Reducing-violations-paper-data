#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

I understand. We need to implement a class that can calculate someone's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the age is given in seconds, and each planet's year is a multiple of Earth years, we can first calculate the age in Earth years, and then divide by the orbital period to get the planet-specific age.

First, let's define the class structure in the header file, and then implement it in the source file.

Wait, the orbital periods are fixed, so we can use them directly. Let's add member functions for each planet.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a constructor that takes age in seconds
2. Add member functions to get the age on each planet
3. The age on each planet is (age in Earth years) / (orbital period)

Since Earth years is (age in seconds) / 31557600

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    long long age_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(long long seconds);
    long long seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these functions in the source file:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_seconds / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return on_earth() / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return on_earth() / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return on_earth() / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a small optimization we can make by always using the base Earth age calculation, which is what we're doing. This implementation should work correctly. Let's test the provided example:
1,000,000,000 seconds should give 31.69 Earth years, which matches 1,000,000,000 / 31,557,600 ≈ 31.688

Wait, the note says 31,557,600 seconds per Earth year, which matches our implementation:
1,000,000,000 / 31,557,600 ≈ 31.688 which rounds to 31.69 when displayed with two decimal places.

This implementation should be correct. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to be precise to pass tests. Let's ensure all calculations are accurate and use the exact values provided. The issue might be with floating point precision or the way we're calculating the ages.

Wait, the problem says to calculate the age on each planet by first converting the age in seconds to Earth years, and then dividing by the orbital period. But actually, it's the other way around: the orbital period tells us how many Earth years make up one year on that planet. So to get the age on another planet, we need to divide the Earth years by the orbital period, which matches our implementation.

However, to ensure precision, we should use exact values and perhaps precompute the Earth age to avoid repeated divisions.

But the implementation looks correct. Let's make sure all values are precise:
- 31557600 seconds per Earth year
- The orbital periods are exact

Wait, the function `seconds()` should return the age in seconds, which we have.
All other functions should return the age on that planet in years.

Let's test with the provided example:
1,000,000,000 seconds is about 31.69 Earth years
On Mercury: 31.69 / 0.2408467 ≈ 131.57

This seems correct.

However, to ensure maximum precision, we can compute the Earth age once and reuse it, but since on_earth() is a simple division, it's fine.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the issue is with the number of decimal places in the tests? Or perhaps we need to use more precise calculations.

Actually, the implementation seems correct. Let's make sure we're using the exact numbers from the instructions:
Orbital periods:
Mercury: 0.2408467
Venus: 0.61519726
Earth: 1.0
Mars: 1.8808158
Jupiter: 11.862615
Saturn: 29.447498
Uranus: 84.016846
Neptune: 164.79132

And Earth year in seconds: 31557600

This matches our implementation. Perhaps the tests expect the age to be stored differently.

Wait, the class needs to be named correctly. The tests might expect the class to be in a certain way.
But the implementation seems correct.

Since the implementation looks correct, and the errors are not specified, I'll assume it's correct.
If there are specific errors, please provide them.

However, to be thorough, let's make sure all calculations are precise by using the exact values from the table:

Wait, the implementation is correct. Let's proceed.
