#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: space_age.h space_age.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a class that can calculate a person's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the age is given in seconds, and each planet has a different orbital period, we can calculate the age by dividing the Earth age (in Earth years) by the orbital period ratio.

First, let's define the class structure in the header file, and then implement it in the source file.

Wait, the instructions say not to change the names of existing functions or classes, but the namespace is empty. So we need to add a class or functions to the namespace.

Since this is C++, it's probably best to create a class that takes the age in seconds in its constructor, and then provides member functions to get the age on each planet.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a class `space_age` to the namespace
2. The constructor takes an integer number of seconds
3. Add member functions for each planet that return the age in years on that planet
4. The age on each planet is (age in Earth years) / (orbital period ratio)

Since the orbital periods are precise, we should use floating point numbers.

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
public:
    explicit space_age(std::int64_t seconds);
    std::int64_t seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
    
private:
    std::int64_t age_in_seconds;
    static constexpr double earth_seconds_per_year = 31557600.0;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the class in space_age.cpp:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(std::int64_t seconds) : age_in_seconds(seconds) {}

std::int64_t space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_in_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_in_seconds) / earth_seconds_per_year) / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_in_seconds) / earth_seconds_per_year) / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_in_seconds) / earth_seconds_per_year;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_in_seconds) / earth_seconds_per_year) / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_in_seconds) / earth_seconds_per_year) / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_in_seconds) / earth_seconds_per_year) / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_in_seconds) / earth_seconds_per_year) / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_in_seconds) / earth_seconds_per_year) / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all floating point operations are precise. Since the orbital periods are given with high precision, using double should be fine.

Also, I'm using static_cast to convert the integer number of seconds to a double to perform floating point division, which is appropriate.

This implementation should work by:
1. Storing the age in seconds when the object is constructed
2. Providing member functions to calculate the age on each planet by:
   a. First converting the age to Earth years (seconds / seconds per Earth year)
   b. Then dividing by the orbital period ratio to get the planet-specific age

This matches the instructions:
- 1,000,000,000 seconds would be 31.69 Earth years (1,000,000,000 / 31,557,600 ≈ 31.69)
- For other planets, we divide this by their orbital period ratio

Let's test this approach:
- Mercury: 31.69 / 0.2408467 ≈ 131.57
- Which matches the example where 50 Earth years would be 50 / 0.2408467 ≈ 207.5 Mercury years

This implementation should be correct. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to be precise and follow the given instructions. Let's fix any potential issues:

1. The orbital periods should be precise
2. We need to ensure all calculations are accurate
3. The implementation should be clean and efficient

Wait, the implementation looks correct, but perhaps the issue is with the precision of the orbital periods. Let's make sure we're using the exact values from the table.

Actually, the implementation seems correct, but let's reorganize it to be more precise by precomputing the Earth age and then dividing by each planet's orbital period.

Wait, the instructions say to use 365.25 days per year, which is exactly 31557600 seconds per Earth year, which matches our implementation.

However, to make sure all calculations are precise, let's use the exact values provided in the table.

Here are the necessary fixes:

space_age.cpp

}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_in_seconds) / earth_seconds_per_year;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {

    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation is cleaner and more efficient because:
1. It reuses the `on_earth()` calculation which is common to all other planet age calculations
2. It's more precise by avoiding repeated divisions
3. It's easier to read and maintain

However, to ensure maximum precision, we need to make sure all the orbital period values are exactly as specified in the table. Since they're hardcoded, this should be fine.

This implementation should now correctly calculate ages on different planets:
- For 1,000,000,000 seconds, on_earth() will be 1000000000.0 / 31557600.0 ≈ 31.68808781402895
- Then for Mercury: 31.68808781402895 / 0.2408467 ≈ 131.5685326

This matches the example where 50 Earth years would be 50 / 0.2408467 ≈ 207.5 Mercury years.

Wait, the instructions say:
> If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.

So our implementation should be precise enough to match this.

This implementation should now be correct and efficient. Let's proceed.
