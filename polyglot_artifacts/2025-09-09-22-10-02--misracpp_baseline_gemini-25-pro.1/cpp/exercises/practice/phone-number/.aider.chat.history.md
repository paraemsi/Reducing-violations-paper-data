#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Clean up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.  
####   
#### The **North American Numbering Plan (NANP)** is a telephone numbering system used by many countries in North America like the United States, Canada or Bermuda.  
#### All NANP-countries share the same international country code: `1`.  
####   
#### NANP numbers are ten-digit numbers consisting of a three-digit Numbering Plan Area code, commonly known as _area code_, followed by a seven-digit local number.  
#### The first three digits of the local number represent the _exchange code_, followed by the unique four-digit number which is the _subscriber number_.  
####   
#### The format is usually represented as  
####   
#### ```text  
#### NXX NXX-XXXX  
#### ```  
####   
#### where `N` is any digit from 2 through 9 and `X` is any digit from 0 through 9.  
####   
#### Sometimes they also have the country code (represented as `1` or `+1`) prefixed.  
####   
#### Your task is to clean up differently formatted telephone numbers by removing punctuation and the country code if present.  
####   
#### For example, the inputs  
####   
#### - `+1 (613)-995-0253`  
#### - `613-995-0253`  
#### - `1 613 995 0253`  
#### - `613.995.0253`  
####   
#### should all produce the output  
####   
#### `6139950253`  
####   
#### **Note:** As this exercise only deals with telephone numbers used in NANP-countries, only 1 is considered a valid country code.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: phone_number.h phone_number.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Based on your request, I will make the following changes to implement the phone number cleaning logic.

I will add a `phone_number` class to the `phone_number` namespace. This class will handle cleaning and validation of North American Numbering Plan (NANP) phone numbers.

In `phone_number.h`, I will define the `phone_number` class, which will have a constructor to process the raw number string, and methods to retrieve the cleaned number, area code, and a formatted string representation.

In `phone_number.cpp`, I will implement the constructor to filter out non-digit characters, handle the optional country code, and validate the number against NANP rules. I will also implement the other methods of the class.

Here are the required changes:

```cpp

    std::string number() const;

};

phone_number::phone_number(const std::string& raw_number) {
    std::string digits;
    for (const char c : raw_number) {
        if (std::isdigit(c)) {
            digits.push_back(c);
        }
    }

    if (digits.length() == 11) {
        if (digits.at(0) == '1') {
            cleaned_number = digits.substr(1);
        } else {
            throw std::domain_error("11-digit number must start with 1");
        }
    } else if (digits.length() == 10) {
        cleaned_number = digits;
    } else {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be 10 or 11 digits");
    }

    if (cleaned_number.at(0) < '2') {
        throw std::domain_error("Area code cannot start with 0 or 1");
    }
    if (cleaned_number.at(3) < '2') {
        throw std::domain_error("Exchange code cannot start with 0 or 1");
    }
}

std::string phone_number::number() const {
    return cleaned_number;
}

std::string phone_number::area_code() const {
    return cleaned_number.substr(0, 3);
}

phone_number::operator std::string() const {
    return "(" + area_code() + ") " + cleaned_number.substr(3, 3) + "-" + cleaned_number.substr(6);
}

}  // namespace phone_number

Based on your request, I've identified two potential issues in the provided code that could be considered errors from a software engineering perspective. I'll propose changes to address them.

First, in `phone_number.h`, the `operator std::string()` conversion is implicit. This can lead to unexpected behavior. I will make it `explicit` to ensure any conversions are intentional, which is a C++ best practice.

Second, the constructor in `phone_number.cpp` is too permissive. It strips all non-digit characters, including letters, which could mask invalid input like `123-456-7890a`. I will add a check to ensure that only digits and expected punctuation (`+`, `(`, `)`, `-`, `.`, ` `) are present in the input string.

Here are the proposed changes:

```cpp
phone_number.h
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    operator std::string() const;
=======
    explicit operator std::string() const;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```cpp
phone_number.cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    for (const char c : raw_number) {
        if (std::isdigit(c)) {
            digits.push_back(c);
        }
    }
=======
    for (const char c : raw_number) {
        if (std::isdigit(c)) {
            digits.push_back(c);
        } else if (c != '(' && c != ')' && c != '-' && c != '.' && c != ' ' && c != '+') {
            throw std::domain_error("invalid character in phone number");
        }
    }

I've reviewed the code you provided. There is a subtle issue in `phone_number.cpp` that could lead to undefined behavior.

The function `std::isdigit` takes an `int` as an argument. If the value is not representable as an `unsigned char` and is not `EOF`, the behavior is undefined. Since `char` can be signed and hold negative values on some platforms, it's a best practice to cast the character to `unsigned char` before passing it to `std::isdigit`.

I will apply this fix.

Here is the required change:

```cpp
phone_number.cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if (std::isdigit(c)) {
=======
        if (std::isdigit(static_cast<unsigned char>(c))) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
