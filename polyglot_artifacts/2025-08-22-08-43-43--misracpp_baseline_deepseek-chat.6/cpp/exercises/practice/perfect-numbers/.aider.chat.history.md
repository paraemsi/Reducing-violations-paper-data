#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of [perfect](#perfect), [abundant](#abundant), or [deficient](#deficient) based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The _aliquot sum_ is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of `15` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.  
####   
#### ## Perfect  
####   
#### A number is perfect when it equals its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `6` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`  
#### - `28` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`  
####   
#### ## Abundant  
####   
#### A number is abundant when it is less than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `12` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
#### - `24` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36`  
####   
#### ## Deficient  
####   
#### A number is deficient when it is greater than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `8` is a deficient number because `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`  
#### - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is [perfect](#perfect).  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is [abundant](#abundant) or [deficient](#deficient).

I understand. We need to implement a classification for numbers based on their aliquot sum. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the task mentions that we may need to determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient, we should probably have a function that can return the classification. However, the instructions aren't clear about the exact interface, so we need to be careful.

Since this is C++, we can use an enumeration to represent the classification types. Let's implement this approach.

First, let's update the header file to declare the enum and a function to classify numbers:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(int num);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the `classify` function in the .cpp file. We need to calculate the aliquot sum and compare it to the number itself:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(int num) {
    if (num <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= num / 2; i++) {
        if (num % i == 0) {
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == num) {
        return perfect;
    } else if (sum > num) {
        return abundant;
    } else {
        return deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to include <stdexcept> for std::domain_error
2. The implementation needs to handle edge cases, like 1 which is deficient (aliquot sum is 0, which is less than 1)
3. We need to make sure we're only summing up proper divisors (excluding the number itself)
4. The implementation needs to be efficient, but for now, a simple approach should work

Wait, the aliquot sum is defined as the sum of factors not including the number itself, which matches our implementation (we're only going up to num/2, which can't include num itself).

This implementation should work:
- For num = 6: divisors are 1, 2, 3 → sum = 6 → perfect
- For num = 12: divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → sum = 16 → abundant
- For num = 8: divisors are 1, 2, 4 → sum = 7 → deficient
- For prime numbers like 7: divisors are 1 → sum = 1 → deficient

This matches all the examples provided. Let's proceed with this implementation.
