#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a clock that handles times without dates.  
####   
#### You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.  
####   
#### Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.cpp clock.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####

I'll implement a clock class that handles times without dates, allowing addition and subtraction of minutes, and ensuring that two clocks representing the same time are equal. Let's think through this:

1. The clock needs to store hours and minutes
2. We need to handle wrapping around when minutes exceed 60 or go below 0
3. We need to handle hours wrapping around 24-hour format
4. We need to implement equality
5. We need to implement addition and subtraction of minutes

Since we need to use fixed-width integer types, we'll include <cstdint>
Let's implement this in the clock.h and clock.cpp files

Here are the necessary changes:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
=======
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

namespace date_independent {
    class clock {
    private:
        std::int32_t total_minutes;
        clock(std::int32_t minutes);
    public:
        static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
        clock plus(std::int32_t minutes) const;
        clock minus(std::int32_t minutes) const;
        operator std::string() const;
        bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
        bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;
    };
}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for clock.cpp, we need to implement these methods:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {
    clock::clock(std::int32_t minutes) : total_minutes(minutes) {}
    
    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        // Normalize to a positive number of minutes within a day
        std::int32_t total = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        // Handle negative values by adding enough days to make it positive
        total %= (24 * 60);
        if (total < 0) {
            total += (24 * 60);
        }
        return clock(total);
    }
    
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        return clock((total_minutes + minutes) % (24 * 60));
    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        // To subtract, we can add negative minutes and handle normalization
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (total_minutes - minutes) % (24 * 60);
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += (24 * 60);
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }
    
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = (total_minutes / 60) % 24;
        std::int32_t minutes = total_minutes % 60;
        
        // Format to two digits each
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << minutes;
        return oss.str();
    }
    
    bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
        return (total_minutes == other.total_minutes);
    }
    
    bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
        return (total_minutes != other.total_minutes);
    }
}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The plus and minus operations need to handle wrapping correctly
2. We need to ensure that the time always stays within a 24-hour period
3. The implementation uses modulo arithmetic to handle wrapping
4. When subtracting, we need to ensure the result is positive by adding 1440 minutes (24 hours) if necessary

Wait, the implementation of plus() needs to handle cases where adding minutes could result in a negative number, but since total_minutes is always between 0 and 1439, and minutes could be negative, we need to be careful.
Actually, the plus() method should always add minutes, which could be positive or negative, and normalize the result.
But the instructions say to add and subtract minutes, so perhaps plus() always adds positive minutes, and minus() always subtracts positive minutes.
But to be safe, we'll implement them to handle any integer input.

However, the implementation above for plus() doesn't handle negative values correctly. Let's fix that:

Wait, the user can pass negative values to plus(), which would be equivalent to subtraction.
But the instructions say to implement plus and subtract minutes, so perhaps we need to always treat the parameter as positive.
But to be general, we'll handle both cases.

Actually, the implementation needs to be robust. Let's modify plus() to handle negative values by calling minus with the absolute value:
But that's not necessary, we can just use the same approach as in minus().

Wait, to make it consistent, we can always normalize the total minutes to be within 0-1439:
Let's modify plus() to be:

Wait, the implementation above for plus() doesn't handle negative values correctly. Let's fix it by always normalizing:
But to avoid code duplication, we can always compute the new total minutes and normalize it.

Wait, let's create a helper function to normalize minutes, but since we can't add new methods, we'll do it inline.

Actually, the implementation needs to be correct:
When adding, we need to handle wrapping around multiple days
So we can compute total_minutes + minutes, then take modulo 1440, and if negative, add 1440

This approach works for both positive and negative values:
Let's reimplement plus() and minus() to use this approach

Wait, minus() can be implemented as plus(-minutes)
So we can write:

clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    return plus(-minutes);
}

But we need to ensure plus() handles negative values correctly:
Let's reimplement plus() to always normalize the result to be between 0 and 1439

Here's the fixed implementation for plus():
```cpp
clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    std::int32_t new_minutes = (total_minutes + minutes) % (24 * 60);
    if (new_minutes < 0) {
        new_minutes += (24 * 60);
    }
    return clock(new_minutes);
}
```

This should work for both positive and negative values of minutes.

I notice that the implementation of `plus()` doesn't handle negative values correctly. Let's fix that. Also, we need to ensure all operations properly normalize the time to be within 0-1439 minutes (0 to 23 hours and 59 minutes).

Here are the necessary fixes:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        return clock((total_minutes + minutes) % (24 * 60));
    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        // To subtract, we can add negative minutes and handle normalization
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (total_minutes - minutes) % (24 * 60);
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += (24 * 60);
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }
=======
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        std::int32_t new_minutes = total_minutes + minutes;
        // Normalize to be within 0-1439
        new_minutes %= (24 * 60);
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += (24 * 60);
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
        // Reuse plus by adding negative minutes
        return plus(-minutes);
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's another issue: the `at()` function needs to handle large or negative inputs correctly. Let's fix that too by always normalizing:

Wait, the implementation of `at()` seems correct, but let's test our approach:
1. Compute total minutes
2. Normalize to be within 0-1439

This should work for any input values of hours and minutes.

Also, the conversion to string needs to ensure hours are always between 0 and 23:
Since total_minutes is always between 0 and 1439, hours will always be between 0 and 23, so (total_minutes / 60) % 24 is redundant.
Let's simplify:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = (total_minutes / 60) % 24;
        std::int32_t minutes = total_minutes % 60;
        
        // Format to two digits each
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << minutes;
        return oss.str();
    }
=======
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = total_minutes / 60;
        std::int32_t minutes = total_minutes % 60;
        
        // Format to two digits each
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << minutes;
        return oss.str();
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Wait, since total_minutes is always between 0 and 1439, hours will always be between 0 and 23, which is correct.

This implementation should now handle:
1. Adding and subtracting minutes correctly, including wrapping around midnight
2. Properly normalizing times to always be valid
3. Comparing clocks based on their internal total_minutes value
4. Converting to a string in the correct format

Let's also make sure all operations follow the MISRA C++ rules:
1. We're using std::int32_t which is appropriate
2. All assignments are between the same types
3. We're using parentheses where necessary
4. All if statements have compound statements
5. We're not using character numerical values

Wait, the implementation looks good in this regard. Let's run through some examples:
- clock::at(8, 0).plus(3) -> 08:03
- clock::at(11, 9).minus(3) -> 11:06
- clock::at(23, 59).plus(2) -> 00:01
- clock::at(0, 45).minus(60) -> 23:45

These should all work with our implementation.
