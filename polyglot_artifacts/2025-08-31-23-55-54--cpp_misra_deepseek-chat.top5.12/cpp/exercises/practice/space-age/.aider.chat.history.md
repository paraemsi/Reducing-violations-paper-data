#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: space_age.h space_age.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a class that can calculate a person's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the age is given in seconds, and each planet has a different orbital period, we can calculate the age by dividing the Earth age (in Earth years) by the orbital period ratio.

First, let's define the class structure in the header file, and then implement it in the source file.

Wait, the instructions say not to change the names of existing functions or classes, but the files seem empty. So we need to add a class or functions to the namespace.

Since this is C++, it's probably best to create a class that holds the age in seconds and provides member functions to get the age on each planet.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a class to space_age.h that takes an age in seconds in its constructor
2. Add member functions for each planet to calculate the age
3. The Earth age in years is seconds / 31557600.0
4. For other planets, divide the Earth age by their orbital period

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    std::int64_t age_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(std::int64_t seconds);
    std::int64_t seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the class in space_age.cpp:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(std::int64_t seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

std::int64_t space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, to ensure precision, we need to be careful with floating point operations. Since the age in seconds can be a large integer, we need to cast it to a double to prevent integer division issues.

This implementation should work:
1. The constructor stores the age in seconds
2. The seconds() method returns the raw age in seconds
3. Each planet method calculates the age by first converting to Earth years, then dividing by the orbital period ratio

Note: All floating point constants are used directly, which should be fine as they fit within the precision of doubles.

This implementation follows the instructions and should pass the tests. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

I understand. The issue is with the use of `std::int64_t` which violates the MISRA C++ rules provided. We need to use a fixed-width type alias instead. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Create a type alias for the integer type
2. Use that alias throughout the implementation
3. Make sure all other rules are followed

This change replaces the direct use of `std::int64_t` with a type alias `age_seconds_t` which is defined as `std::int64_t`. This satisfies the MISRA C++ rule which says:
"The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used"

By using the alias, we're not directly using the standard integer type name, which complies with the rule. The implementation remains the same, just with the type names changed to use the alias.

This should now pass the checks. Let me know if there are any other issues!

I understand. The issue is that we're still using `std::int64_t` directly in the type alias, which violates the MISRA C++ rule that says we shouldn't use the names of standard integer types. Let's fix this by using a fixed-width type from `<cstdint>`.

Wait, the rule says:
"The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used"
But it also says:
"Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, etc."

So `std::int64_t` is actually a fixed-width type from `<cstdint>`, which should be allowed. But perhaps the issue is that we're using it directly rather than through an alias.

Wait, the rule says to create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias. We're doing that, so it should be fine.

Perhaps the issue is that the rule wants us to use the fixed-width types, and we are. Maybe there's another issue.

Wait, the user marked lines 8, 15, and 16. Let's see:
Line 8: using age_seconds_t = std::int64_t;
Line 15: age_seconds_t seconds() const;
Line 16: double on_mercury() const;

Perhaps the issue is that the return type of seconds() should be consistent with the type used in the constructor, which it is. Or maybe there's another rule being violated.

Actually, the rule says:
"Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate"
But we're not doing any assignments here that would violate this.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the function names don't match what's expected. But the instructions say not to change existing function names.

Wait, the user may be pointing out that the implementation needs to be checked against the rules. Let's make sure all calculations are properly parenthesized according to the rules.

Let's fix the implementation to ensure all expressions are properly parenthesized:

Wait, I added parentheses around the division in `on_earth()`, but that's not necessary since there's only one operation. But according to the rules, we need to ensure all expressions are properly parenthesized. However, the rules say:
"Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level."
Since there's only one operator here, no parentheses are needed.

Actually, the implementation seems fine. Maybe the issue is elsewhere.

Perhaps the user wants to ensure that the type alias is defined in a certain way. Let's make sure we're using the fixed-width types correctly.

Wait, the rule says:
"raw basic type only inside the alias definition"
Which we are doing.

I'm not sure what the issue is. Let's try to be more precise with our types and casts to ensure compliance with all rules.

Wait, the rules say:
"Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness"
We're casting from age_seconds_t (which is std::int64_t) to double, which is a widening conversion, so that's fine.

Perhaps the issue is that the marked lines are just for information, and there are no actual errors. But the user said to fix any errors below, if possible.

Since I can't identify any clear errors, and the implementation seems correct, I'll assume the current implementation is acceptable. If there are specific errors, please provide more details.
