#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement the classic method for composing secret messages called a square code.  
####   
#### Given an English text, output the encoded version of that text.  
####   
#### First, the input is normalized: the spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the message is down-cased.  
####   
#### Then, the normalized characters are broken into rows.  
#### These rows can be regarded as forming a rectangle when printed with intervening newlines.  
####   
#### For example, the sentence  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "If man was meant to stay on the ground, god would have given us roots."  
#### ```  
####   
#### is normalized to:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "ifmanwasmeanttostayonthegroundgodwouldhavegivenusroots"  
#### ```  
####   
#### The plaintext should be organized into a rectangle as square as possible.  
#### The size of the rectangle should be decided by the length of the message.  
####   
#### If `c` is the number of columns and `r` is the number of rows, then for the rectangle `r` x `c` find the smallest possible integer `c` such that:  
####   
#### - `r * c >= length of message`,  
#### - and `c >= r`,  
#### - and `c - r <= 1`.  
####   
#### Our normalized text is 54 characters long, dictating a rectangle with `c = 8` and `r = 7`:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "ifmanwas"  
#### "meanttos"  
#### "tayonthe"  
#### "groundgo"  
#### "dwouldha"  
#### "vegivenu"  
#### "sroots  "  
#### ```  
####   
#### The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right.  
####   
#### The message above is coded as:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvsfearwermayoogoanouuiontnnlvtwttddesaohghnsseoau"  
#### ```  
####   
#### Output the encoded text in chunks that fill perfect rectangles `(r X c)`, with `c` chunks of `r` length, separated by spaces.  
#### For phrases that are `n` characters short of the perfect rectangle, pad each of the last `n` chunks with a single trailing space.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn  sseoau "  
#### ```  
####   
#### Notice that were we to stack these, we could visually decode the ciphertext back in to the original message:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvs"  
#### "fearwer"  
#### "mayoogo"  
#### "anouuio"  
#### "ntnnlvt"  
#### "wttddes"  
#### "aohghn "  
#### "sseoau "  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: crypto_square.h crypto_square.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll analyze this carefully. We need to implement a class that can encode text according to the crypto square cipher. Let's break it down:

1. Normalize the input: remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
2. Determine the number of columns (c) and rows (r) that satisfy:
   - r * c >= length of normalized text
   - c >= r
   - c - r <= 1
3. Organize the normalized text into a grid with r rows and c columns, padding with spaces if necessary
4. Read down the columns to get the encoded text, and then split into chunks of r characters separated by spaces

Since the function signatures aren't provided, I'll need to add them. Let's add a class with an encode method.

Wait, the files are empty, so we need to define everything from scratch.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a class definition in the header file
2. Implement the class methods in the cpp file

Here are the necessary changes:

crypto_square.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CRYPTO_SQUARE_H)
#define CRYPTO_SQUARE_H

namespace crypto_square {

}  // namespace crypto_square

#endif // CRYPTO_SQUARE_H
=======
#if !defined(CRYPTO_SQUARE_H)
#define CRYPTO_SQUARE_H

#include <string>

namespace crypto_square {

class cipher {
public:
    cipher(const std::string& text);
    std::string normalize_plain_text() const;
    std::size_t size() const;
    std::string cipher_text() const;
private:
    std::string normalized;
};

}  // namespace crypto_square

#endif // CRYPTO_SQUARE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in crypto_square.cpp:

crypto_square.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "crypto_square.h"

namespace crypto_square {

}  // namespace crypto_square
=======
#include "crypto_square.h"
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <cctype>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

namespace crypto_square {

cipher::cipher(const std::string& text) {
    // Normalize the input text
    for (char c : text) {
        if (std::isalnum(c)) {
            normalized += std::tolower(c);
        }
    }
}

std::string cipher::normalize_plain_text() const {
    return normalized;
}

std::size_t cipher::size() const {
    if (normalized.empty()) return 0;
    // Find the smallest c where c >= r and c - r <= 1
    // Since r * c >= length, and c >= r, and c - r <= 1
    // We can find the number of columns by taking the ceiling of the square root
    std::size_t length = normalized.size();
    std::size_t c = static_cast<std::size_t>(std::ceil(std::sqrt(length)));
    return c;
}

std::string cipher::cipher_text() const {
    if (normalized.empty()) return "";
    
    // Determine number of columns and rows
    std::size_t c = size();
    std::size_t length = normalized.size();
    // Calculate number of rows
    std::size_t r = (length + c - 1) / c; // This ensures r*c >= length
    
    // Create a grid
    std::vector<std::string> grid(r, std::string(c, ' '));
    
    // Fill the grid row by row
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
        grid[i / c][i % c] = normalized[i];
    }
    
    // Read down the columns to form the encoded text
    std::string result;
    for (std::size_t col = 0; col < c; ++col) {
        for (std::size_t row = 0; row < r; ++row) {
            result += grid[row][col];
        }
        // Add space between chunks, but not after the last one
        if (col < c - 1) {
            result += ' ';
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

}  // namespace crypto_square
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a condition that c >= r and c - r <= 1. Let's make sure our implementation satisfies this:
- c is the ceiling of the square root, which ensures c >= r
- Since r is the smallest integer where r * c >= length, and c is ceiling(sqrt(length)), 
  c will be either equal to r or r + 1, which satisfies c - r <= 1

Wait, but the number of rows r should be such that r * c >= length, and c >= r, and c - r <= 1
So, c is the ceiling of the square root, and r is the floor of the square root or floor + 1
But to always satisfy c >= r, we can set r to be the floor of (length + c - 1)/c which is correct

This implementation should work. Let's test the example:
Normalized length: 54
sqrt(54) ≈ 7.348 → c = 8
r = ceil(54/8) = 7
Which matches the example: 8 >= 7 and 8-7=1 <=1

This implementation should work. Let's proceed.

I notice that the function names in the header don't match the typical naming conventions for the exercise. Let me check the instructions again. The class should probably be named `crypto_square` or something else, but the instructions say not to change existing function or class names. Since the class is named `cipher`, we'll keep that.

However, the implementation needs to be fixed to match the requirements:
1. The encoded text should be in chunks that fill perfect rectangles (c chunks of r length)
2. Pad each of the last n chunks with a single trailing space if necessary
3. The implementation needs to ensure that c >= r and c - r <= 1

Wait, the implementation of `size()` should return the number of columns, which is correct.
But the implementation of `cipher_text()` needs to be fixed to ensure proper padding and formatting.

The main issue is that the number of rows and columns must satisfy:
1. r * c >= length
2. c >= r
3. c - r <= 1

Let's fix the implementation:

crypto_square.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
std::size_t cipher::size() const {
    if (normalized.empty()) return 0;
    // Find the smallest c where c >= r and c - r <= 1
    // Since r * c >= length, and c >= r, and c - r <= 1
    // We can find the number of columns by taking the ceiling of the square root
    std::size_t length = normalized.size();
    std::size_t c = static_cast<std::size_t>(std::ceil(std::sqrt(length)));
    return c;
}

std::string cipher::cipher_text() const {
    if (normalized.empty()) return "";
    
    // Determine number of columns and rows
    std::size_t c = size();
    std::size_t length = normalized.size();
    // Calculate number of rows
    std::size_t r = (length + c - 1) / c; // This ensures r*c >= length
    
    // Create a grid
    std::vector<std::string> grid(r, std::string(c, ' '));
    
    // Fill the grid row by row
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
        grid[i / c][i % c] = normalized[i];
    }
    
    // Read down the columns to form the encoded text
    std::string result;
    for (std::size_t col = 0; col < c; ++col) {
        for (std::size_t row = 0; row < r; ++row) {
            result += grid[row][col];
        }
        // Add space between chunks, but not after the last one
        if (col < c - 1) {
            result += ' ';
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
=======
std::size_t cipher::size() const {
    if (normalized.empty()) return 0;
    std::size_t length = normalized.size();
    // Find the number of columns c which is the ceiling of the square root
    std::size_t c = static_cast<std::size_t>(std::ceil(std::sqrt(length)));
    return c;
}

std::string cipher::cipher_text() const {
    if (normalized.empty()) return "";

    std::size_t length = normalized.size();
    // Calculate number of rows r
    // We need to find r such that r * c >= length, and c >= r, and c - r <= 1
    // Since c is ceiling(sqrt(length)), r will be floor(length/c) or ceil(length/c)
    std::size_t r = (length + c - 1) / c; // This is integer ceiling division
    
    // Create a grid with r rows and c columns, padding with spaces
    std::vector<std::string> rows(r, std::string(c, ' '));
    // Fill the grid
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        rows[i / c][i % c] = normalized[i];
    }
    
    // Build the encoded text by reading down the columns
    std::string encoded;
    for (std::size_t col = 0; col < c; col++) {
        for (std::size_t row = 0; row < r; row++) {
            encoded += rows[row][col];
        }
        // Add a space after each column chunk except the last one
        if (col != c - 1) {
            encoded += ' ';
        }
    }
    
    return encoded;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue: the number of rows and columns must satisfy c >= r and c - r <= 1
Let's ensure that:
Since c = ceil(sqrt(L)), and r = ceil(L/c)
We need to verify that c >= r and c - r <= 1

For L=54:
c = ceil(sqrt(54)) = 8
r = ceil(54/8) = 7
8 >= 7 and 8-7=1 <=1: valid

For L=1:
c = ceil(sqrt(1)) =1
r = ceil(1/1)=1
1>=1 and 1-1=0<=1: valid

For L=2:
c = ceil(sqrt(2)) =2
r = ceil(2/2)=1
2>=1 and 2-1=1<=1: valid

This seems correct.

This implementation should now work according to the instructions. Let's proceed.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in crypto_square.h crypto_square.cpp to resolve the errors.  

I understand. The tests are expecting a member function called `normalized_cipher_text()`, but our implementation has `cipher_text()`. Let's fix that and ensure the implementation matches the requirements.

The `normalized_cipher_text()` should return the encoded text in chunks separated by spaces, which is what we're doing in `cipher_text()`. So we just need to rename the function.

Here are the necessary changes:

crypto_square.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    cipher(const std::string& text);
    std::string normalize_plain_text() const;
    std::size_t size() const;
    std::string cipher_text() const;
=======
    cipher(const std::string& text);
    std::string normalize_plain_text() const;
    std::size_t size() const;
    std::string normalized_cipher_text() const;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

crypto_square.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
std::string cipher::cipher_text() const {
=======
std::string cipher::normalized_cipher_text() const {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This should now match what the tests expect. Let's run the tests again.

The implementation looks correct, but let's make sure it matches the test cases. The tests are expecting certain behavior, and we need to ensure our implementation aligns with that.

However, the implementation seems to be correct according to the instructions:
1. Normalize the input by removing non-alphanumeric characters and downcasing
2. Organize into a rectangle where c >= r and c - r <= 1
3. Read down the columns to get the encoded text, with spaces between chunks

Wait, the number of rows and columns must satisfy:
r * c >= length(message)
c >= r
c - r <= 1

But in our implementation, we always set c to ceiling(sqrt(L)), which may not always satisfy c >= r and c - r <= 1
Actually, we need to find c and r that satisfy all three conditions

Let's fix the implementation to always find valid c and r:

crypto_square.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
std::size_t cipher::size() const {
    if (normalized.empty()) return 0;
    std::size_t length = normalized.size();
    // Find the number of columns c which is the ceiling of the square root
    std::size_t c = static_cast<std::size_t>(std::ceil(std::sqrt(length)));
    return c;
}

std::string cipher::normalized_cipher_text() const {
    if (normalized.empty()) return "";
    
    std::size_t c = size();
    std::size_t length = normalized.size();
    // Calculate number of rows r
    // We need to find r such that r * c >= length, and c >= r, and c - r <= 1
    // Since c is ceiling(sqrt(length)), r will be floor(length/c) or ceil(length/c)
    std::size_t r = (length + c - 1) / c; // This is integer ceiling division
    
    // Create a grid with r rows and c columns, padding with spaces
    std::vector<std::string> rows(r, std::string(c, ' '));
    // Fill the grid
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        rows[i / c][i % c] = normalized[i];
    }
    
    // Build the encoded text by reading down the columns
    std::string encoded;
    for (std::size_t col = 0; col < c; col++) {
        for (std::size_t row = 0; row < r; row++) {
            encoded += rows[row][col];
        }
        // Add a space after each column chunk except the last one
        if (col != c - 1) {
            encoded += ' ';
        }
    }
    
    return encoded;
}
=======
std::size_t cipher::size() const {
    if (normalized.empty()) return 0;
    std::size_t length = normalized.size();
    // Find the number of columns c that satisfies all conditions
    std::size_t c = static_cast<std::size_t>(std::ceil(std::sqrt(length)));
    // Calculate number of rows r
    std::size_t r = (length + c - 1) / c; // Ceiling division
    
    // Adjust to meet all conditions
    // We need to ensure c >= r and c - r <= 1
    // If not, we may need to adjust c and r
    while (c < r || (c - r) > 1) {
        c++;
        r = (length + c - 1) / c;
    }
    return c;
}

std::string cipher::normalized_cipher_text() const {
    if (normalized.empty()) return "";
    
    std::size_t length = normalized.size();
    // Determine c and r that satisfy all conditions
    std::size_t c = size();
    std::size_t r = (length + c - 1) / c;
    
    // Adjust to meet all conditions
    while (c < r || (c - r) > 1) {
        c++;
        r = (length + c - 1) / c;
    }
    
    // Create a grid with r rows and c columns, padding with spaces
    std::vector<std::string> rows(r, std::string(c, ' '));
    // Fill the grid
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        rows[i / c][i % c] = normalized[i];
    }
    
    // Build the encoded text by reading down the columns
    std::string encoded;
    for (std::size_t col = 0; col < c; col++) {
        for (std::size_t row = 0; row < r; row++) {
            encoded += rows[row][col];
        }
        // Add a space after each column chunk except the last one
        if (col != c - 1) {
            encoded += ' ';
        }
    }
    
    return encoded;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation ensures that we always find valid values for c and r that satisfy:
1. r * c >= length
2. c >= r
3. c - r <= 1

However, this may not be the most efficient approach, but it should work for the test cases.

Let's hope this resolves any issues with the tests. If there are still problems, we may need to see specific test cases to understand what's expected.
