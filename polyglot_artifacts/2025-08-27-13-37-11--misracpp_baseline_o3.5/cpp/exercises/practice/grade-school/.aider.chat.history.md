#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.  
####   
#### In the end, you should be able to:  
####   
#### - Add a student's name to the roster for a grade  
####   - "Add Jim to grade 2."  
####   - "OK."  
#### - Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade  
####   - "Which students are in grade 2?"  
####   - "We've only got Jim just now."  
#### - Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  
####   Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.  
####   - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"  
####   - "Let me think.  
####     We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.  
####     So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"  
####   
#### Note that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.  
#### In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grade_school.h grade_school.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
