#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of [perfect](#perfect), [abundant](#abundant), or [deficient](#deficient) based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The _aliquot sum_ is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of `15` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.  
####   
#### ## Perfect  
####   
#### A number is perfect when it equals its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `6` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`  
#### - `28` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`  
####   
#### ## Abundant  
####   
#### A number is abundant when it is less than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `12` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
#### - `24` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36`  
####   
#### ## Deficient  
####   
#### A number is deficient when it is greater than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `8` is a deficient number because `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`  
#### - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is [perfect](#perfect).  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is [abundant](#abundant) or [deficient](#deficient).

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: perfect_numbers.cpp perfect_numbers.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a classification for numbers based on their aliquot sum. Let's think through this carefully.

Since we're dealing with positive integers, we need to calculate the sum of all proper divisors (factors excluding the number itself) and compare it to the number to determine if it's perfect, abundant, or deficient.

However, the instructions mention that depending on the language track, we may need to implement classification for all three types. Since the function signatures aren't provided, I'll assume we need to implement a function that can classify a number into one of these categories.

Let's add an enum to represent the classification and a function to determine the classification.

Wait, the files provided are empty namespaces, so we need to add everything from scratch.

Here's the plan:
1. Add an enum class to represent the number classification
2. Add a function that takes a number and returns its classification
3. Implement the logic to find all proper divisors and sum them
4. Compare the sum to the number to determine the classification

Since we need to follow MISRA C++ rules, we'll use fixed-width integer types.

Here are the necessary changes:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int64_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in perfect_numbers.cpp:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Sum of proper divisors
    std::int64_t sum = 0;
    for (std::int64_t i = 1; i <= (number / 2); i++) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to handle numbers <= 0, which are invalid according to the instructions (positive integers)
2. We're using std::int64_t to handle potentially large numbers
3. We're only checking up to number/2 to find divisors, which is efficient
4. We're following the classification scheme by comparing the aliquot sum to the number

This implementation should work for the requirements:
- Perfect: aliquot sum equals the number
- Abundant: aliquot sum is greater than the number
- Deficient: aliquot sum is less than the number

However, the instructions mention that prime numbers are deficient, which aligns with our implementation because the aliquot sum of a prime number is always 1 (only proper divisor is 1), which is less than the number itself.

This implementation should be efficient enough for most cases, though for very large numbers, more optimized approaches could be used. But since the instructions don't specify performance requirements, this should be fine.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle potential issues. Let's analyze and fix any problems:

1. The implementation may be inefficient for large numbers
2. We need to ensure we're following best practices
3. Let's optimize the divisor finding by only going up to the square root

Wait, but we need to be careful:
- When we find a divisor i, we also get number/i as a divisor
- But we need to make sure not to include the number itself
- Also, for perfect squares, we need to avoid adding the square root twice

Wait, the aliquot sum is the sum of proper divisors, which are all divisors except the number itself
So we can find all divisors up to the square root and sum them appropriately

Here's an optimized approach:
1. Start sum at 1 (since 1 is always a proper divisor)
2. Check up to the square root
3. For each divisor i found, add both i and number/i to the sum
4. Adjust for perfect squares
5. Subtract the number if it was added, but since we're only adding proper divisors, we need to be careful

Wait, but number/i could be equal to number, which we don't want to include
So we need to make sure i > 1 to avoid adding number when i=1

Actually, let's implement it properly:
1. For i from 2 up to sqrt(number)
2. If i divides number, add i + number/i
3. But make sure number/i != number (which it won't be since i >= 2)
4. Handle the case where number is 1 separately

Wait, number=1: proper divisors are none, so sum is 0 which is less than 1 → deficient

Here's the revised implementation:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Sum of proper divisors
    std::int64_t sum = 0;
    for (std::int64_t i = 1; i <= (number / 2); i++) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle number == 1 case
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); i++) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation is more efficient, especially for large numbers, as it only goes up to the square root of the number. Let's test the cases:
- Number 6: divisors are 1, 2, 3 → sum=6 → perfect
- Number 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 → sum=28 → perfect
- Number 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → sum=16 → abundant
- Number 8: 1, 2, 4 → sum=7 → deficient
- Number 1: sum=0 → deficient

Wait, but in our implementation, for number=1, we handle it separately to return deficient, which matches the note that prime numbers are deficient (though 1 is not prime, it's still deficient according to the aliquot sum)

This implementation should now be correct and efficient. Let's also make sure to include <cmath> for std::sqrt.
