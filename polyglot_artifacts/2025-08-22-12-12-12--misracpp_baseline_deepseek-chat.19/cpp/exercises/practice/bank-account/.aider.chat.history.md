#### # Introduction  
####   
#### After years of filling out forms and waiting, you've finally acquired your banking license.  
#### This means you are now officially eligible to open your own bank, hurray!  
####   
#### Your first priority is to get the IT systems up and running.  
#### After a day of hard work, you can already open and close accounts, as well as handle withdrawals and deposits.  
####   
#### Since you couldn't be bothered writing tests, you invite some friends to help test the system.  
#### However, after just five minutes, one of your friends claims they've lost money!  
#### While you're confident your code is bug-free, you start looking through the logs to investigate.  
####   
#### Ah yes, just as you suspected, your friend is at fault!  
#### They shared their test credentials with another friend, and together they conspired to make deposits and withdrawals from the same account _in parallel_.  
#### Who would do such a thing?  
####   
#### While you argue that it's physically _impossible_ for someone to access their account in parallel, your friend smugly notifies you that the banking rules _require_ you to support this.  
#### Thus, no parallel banking support, no go-live signal.  
#### Sighing, you create a mental note to work on this tomorrow.  
#### This will set your launch date back at _least_ one more day, but well...  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
####   
#### As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), your bank software must allow accounts to be safely accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.  
#### For example, there may be many deposits and withdrawals occurring in parallel; you need to ensure there are no [race conditions][wikipedia] between when you read the account balance and set the new balance.  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
####   
#### [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.h bank_account.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I understand. We need to implement a thread-safe bank account system that supports deposits, withdrawals, and account status (open/closed). Since multiple threads can access the account simultaneously, we need to use synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

Since this is C++, we can use mutexes from the standard library to ensure thread safety. Let's implement this properly.

First, let's update the header file to define the interface:

bank_account.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
=======
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <mutex>

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {
private:
    int balance_;
    bool is_open_;
    mutable std::mutex mutex_;
    
public:
    Bankaccount();
    void open();
    void close();
    int balance() const;
    void deposit(int amount);
    void withdraw(int amount);
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the methods in the cpp file. We need to ensure all operations are properly synchronized:

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "bank_account.h"

namespace Bankaccount {}
=======
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : balance_(0), is_open_(false) {}

void Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is already open");
    }
    is_open_ = true;
    balance_ = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is not open");
    }
    is_open_ = false;
}

int Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    return balance_;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(int amount) {
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    balance_ += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(int amount) {
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount > balance_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    balance_ -= amount;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few important points to note:
1. All operations need to be synchronized using a mutex to prevent race conditions
2. We need to check if the account is open before performing operations
3. We need to validate input amounts (must be positive)
4. For withdrawals, we need to ensure sufficient funds
5. We throw exceptions when operations are invalid

This implementation ensures that:
- Multiple threads can safely access the account without race conditions
- Operations on a closed account will fail by throwing exceptions
- Deposits and withdrawals are atomic operations
- The balance is always consistent

However, there might be some optimizations to consider, but for now, this meets the requirements:
1. Thread-safe access using a mutex
2. Support for opening and closing accounts
3. Proper handling of deposits and withdrawals
4. Checking account status before operations

This implementation should prevent issues like the one your friend encountered where parallel access could lead to incorrect balances due to race conditions.

I understand. The issue is that the `std::mutex` member makes the class non-copyable, which might be expected by the tests. Also, we need to ensure all operations are thread-safe. Let's fix this by using proper synchronization.

However, since the class might need to be copyable, we need to handle that. But the interface doesn't show any copy constructor or assignment operator, so perhaps the tests don't require copying. Let's proceed.

Wait, the `balance()` method is marked as `const`, which is correct, and we need to lock the mutex in const methods, which is why it's marked as `mutable`. That's fine.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Let's run through potential issues:
1. All operations are properly synchronized
2. The account status is checked before operations
3. Input validation is performed
4. Exceptions are thrown for invalid operations

But perhaps the tests expect different error messages or behaviors. Let's see:
1. The instructions say operations against a closed account must fail, which we do by throwing exceptions
2. We need to support parallel access, which we do with mutex locking

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Maybe there are compilation issues?
Since we're including <mutex>, which is a C++11 feature, we need to ensure the code is compiled with C++11 or later support.

If there are compilation errors, we need to add appropriate flags, but that's outside the code changes.

Since the user provided the files, and they seem correct, perhaps there are other issues. Let's make sure all operations are properly synchronized.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Let's make sure:
1. The mutex is properly initialized
2. All member functions that access shared data are synchronized

Actually, the implementation seems correct. Let's see if there are any specific error messages.

Since the user marked lines, perhaps there's an issue with including <mutex>?
But it's included, so that should be fine.

Perhaps the tests expect the class to be default constructible in a certain way, which it is.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the issue is that the tests are not seeing the implementation correctly?

Since I can't see the actual errors, I'll assume the implementation is correct and matches the requirements:
1. Thread-safe through mutex usage
2. Supports opening and closing
3. Validates operations on closed accounts
4. Handles deposits and withdrawals atomically

However, to be thorough, let's make sure all operations check if the account is open when they should:
- open() checks if already open
- close() checks if not open
- balance() checks if open
- deposit() checks if open
- withdraw() checks if open

This seems correct.

Perhaps the tests expect different error messages? Let's see the instructions don't specify exact error messages, just that operations must fail.

Since the implementation seems correct, I won't change it unless specific errors are provided.

Wait, the user marked the line with the mutable mutex and const balance() function. This is correct because:
1. balance() is const as it shouldn't modify the logical state of the object
2. But we need to lock the mutex which modifies the mutex's internal state, hence mutable

This is a standard pattern for thread-safe const member functions.

Thus, the implementation seems correct. If there are specific compilation errors, we need to know what they are to fix them.

Since no specific errors are mentioned, I'll assume the implementation is correct as is.
