#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a fancy store.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value and weight.  
#### Bob would gladly take all of the items, but his knapsack can only hold so much weight.  
#### Bob has to carefully consider which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to determine which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized, taking into account the knapsack's carrying capacity.  
####   
#### Items will be represented as a list of items.  
#### Each item will have a weight and value.  
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10  
#### ```  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.cpp knapsack.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a function to solve the classic 0/1 knapsack problem, where we want to maximize the total value without exceeding the maximum weight capacity. Since we can only take each item once, this is a dynamic programming problem.

Since the implementation needs to be in C++ and follow specific guidelines, we need to be careful about types and other constraints. Let's implement this.

First, we need to include the necessary headers and define the function signature. Since the items are given as a list, and the maximum weight is provided, we need to return the maximum value.

However, the instructions don't specify the exact function signature, so we need to add a function to the namespace. Let's add a function that takes a vector of Items and a maximum weight, and returns the maximum value.

Since weights and values are integers, and the maximum weight can be up to a certain value, we can use dynamic programming where dp[i] represents the maximum value achievable with weight i.

Wait, to follow the MISRA rules, we need to use fixed-width integer types. Let's include <cstdint> and use appropriate types.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Add necessary includes
2. Implement the maximum_value function

Here are the planned changes:

knapsack.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    int weight;
    int value;
};

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
=======
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    std::int32_t weight;
    std::int32_t value;
};

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items);

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation in knapsack.cpp, we'll use dynamic programming:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"

namespace knapsack
{

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty())
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores maximum value for weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    return *std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. All values are strictly positive, which is good
2. We need to ensure we're following the MISRA rules, which we are by using std::int32_t
3. The implementation uses dynamic programming which is efficient for this problem
4. We process items in a way that each item is only considered once

This implementation should work within the constraints:
- It handles up to maximum_weight of 1000 or more efficiently
- It correctly computes the maximum value by considering each item only once
- It's O(n * W) where n is number of items and W is maximum weight

However, if maximum_weight is very large, this approach may not be the most efficient, but it's standard for the knapsack problem. Since the problem statement doesn't specify constraints, we'll assume this is sufficient.

Let's test the provided example:
Items: weights [5,4,6,4], values [10,40,30,50], max weight 10
The implementation should find the maximum value to be 90 (items 2 and 4) which matches the example.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle cases where maximum_weight could be 0, and to ensure it always works correctly. Let's fix the implementation.

However, the implementation looks correct, but there might be an issue when maximum_weight is 0. Let's test:
- If maximum_weight is 0, we can't take any items, so the maximum value should be 0
- The implementation should handle this correctly

Wait, the implementation always creates a vector of size maximum_weight + 1, which could be 1 when maximum_weight is 0, which is fine.
But if maximum_weight is 0, the inner loop condition w >= item.weight will never be true for any item (since item.weight >= 1), so dp[0] remains 0, which is correct.

However, to find the maximum value, we can just take dp[maximum_weight] because in the standard knapsack implementation, we always fill up to the maximum weight, and the maximum value might be at a weight less than maximum_weight, but our implementation always keeps track of the best value up to each weight.

Wait, the implementation uses *std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end()), which is correct to find the maximum value across all weights.

But to follow the MISRA rules, we need to ensure all operations are correct:
1. No mixing of types
2. All assignments are appropriate
3. Parentheses are used correctly

Let's fix any potential issues:

Here are the necessary fixes:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty())
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores maximum value for weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    return *std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty() || (maximum_weight <= 0))
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores maximum value for weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(static_cast<std::size_t>(maximum_weight) + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
        // We need to cast to avoid signed/unsigned comparisons
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            std::int32_t const new_value = dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w) - static_cast<std::size_t>(item.weight)] + item.value;
            if (dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)] < new_value)
            {
                dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)] = new_value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    return *std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few important points:
1. We need to ensure all array indices are non-negative, which they are
2. We need to cast indices to std::size_t to avoid signed/unsigned issues
3. We need to ensure maximum_weight is non-negative, which it should be according to the problem
4. All operations are between std::int32_t, which is good

This implementation should now follow the MISRA rules:
1. No mixing of types: we're using explicit casts
2. All assignments are between the same types
3. Parentheses are used appropriately

However, the implementation could be optimized, but let's focus on correctness first.

Wait, the maximum_weight parameter is std::int32_t, which can be negative, but the problem says weights are strictly positive, and maximum weight should be non-negative.
To be safe, we check if maximum_weight <= 0 and return 0 immediately.

This implementation should now work correctly for all cases:
- No items
- Maximum weight is 0
- Regular cases

Let's test our implementation with the provided example:
Items: weights [5,4,6,4], values [10,40,30,50], max weight 10
Processing:
1. Initialize dp[0..10] = 0
2. For each item, update dp in reverse
   This should give the correct maximum value of 90

This implementation should work. Let's proceed.
