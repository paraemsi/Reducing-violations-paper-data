#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: space_age.h space_age.cpp

I understand. We need to create a class that can calculate someone's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the age is given in seconds, and each planet's year is relative to Earth years, we can first calculate the age in Earth years, and then divide by the orbital period to get the planet-specific age.

First, we need to define a class in the header file that can store the age in seconds and provide methods to get the age on each planet.

Wait, the instructions say not to change existing functions or classes, but the namespace is empty. So we need to add a class within the namespace.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a class `space_age` that takes seconds in its constructor
2. Add methods to get the age on each planet
3. The age on each planet is (age in Earth years) / (orbital period)
4. Age in Earth years is seconds / 31557600

Let's implement this:

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    long long age_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(long long seconds);
    long long seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation in space_age.cpp:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_seconds / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return on_earth() / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return on_earth() / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return on_earth() / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to make sure all calculations are precise. Since we're dealing with floating point numbers, using double precision should be fine. Let's test this approach:

1. For 1,000,000,000 seconds, on_earth() should be ~31.69
2. Then, for other planets, it's divided by their orbital periods

This implementation should work. Let's break it down:
- The constructor stores the age in seconds
- seconds() returns the raw seconds
- Each on_*() method calculates the age on that planet by first getting Earth years and dividing by the orbital period

This seems correct. Let's proceed with these changes.

I understand. The implementation needs to be precise to pass tests. Let's ensure all calculations are accurate. The issue might be with floating point precision or the order of operations. Let's make sure we're using the correct approach.

Since the age on each planet is (seconds) / (Earth seconds per year * orbital period), we can compute it directly:
age_seconds / (31557600 * orbital_period)

This might be more precise than dividing by the orbital period after computing Earth years, due to floating point precision.

Wait, but the implementation seems correct. Maybe the tests expect a certain number of decimal places? Or perhaps there's a different issue.

Actually, the instructions say to calculate the age on other planets by dividing the Earth years by their orbital period, which matches our implementation.

But to be precise, let's use the exact values from the table:
Mercury: 0.2408467
Venus: 0.61519726
Earth: 1.0
Mars: 1.8808158
Jupiter: 11.862615
Saturn: 29.447498
Uranus: 84.016846
Neptune: 164.79132

Wait, the Earth year in seconds is 31557600, which is correct.

Perhaps the issue is with the implementation of the seconds() function? It should return the stored seconds, which it does.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the tests are failing due to floating point precision issues? Let's make sure we're using the most precise approach.

Let's compute each planet's age directly:
age_seconds / (31557600 * orbital_period)

This might be better to avoid compounding floating point errors.

Wait, but the implementation is correct. Maybe the issue is that the tests expect the age to be computed in a specific way.

Actually, let's reimplement each method to compute directly:
For example, on_mercury() would be: age_seconds / (31557600 * 0.2408467)

This should be more precise.

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_seconds / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return on_earth() / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return on_earth() / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return on_earth() / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_seconds / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 0.2408467);
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 0.61519726);
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 1.8808158);
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 11.862615);
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 29.447498);
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 84.016846);
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 164.79132);
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should be more precise by avoiding division operations that could compound floating point errors. Each calculation is done directly using multiplication which can be more accurate.

However, both approaches are mathematically equivalent:
age_seconds / (31557600 * period) vs (age_seconds / 31557600) / period

But due to floating point precision, there might be slight differences. Let's use the direct approach to be safe.

This should now pass any tests that are checking for precise values. Let's hope this fixes any issues.
