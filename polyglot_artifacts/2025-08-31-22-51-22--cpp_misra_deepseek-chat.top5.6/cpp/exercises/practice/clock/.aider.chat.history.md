#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a clock that handles times without dates.  
####   
#### You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.  
####   
#### Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.cpp clock.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. Let's implement a clock that handles times without dates, allowing addition and subtraction of minutes, and ensuring that two clocks representing the same time are equal.

Since we need to use fixed-width integer types, we'll include <cstdint>.
The implementation will likely need to represent time in minutes since midnight (0-1439 minutes per day).
To handle wrapping around when adding or subtracting minutes, we can use modulo arithmetic.

Let's implement a Clock class that stores minutes since midnight and provides methods to add and subtract minutes.
We'll also need to implement equality operators.

However, the provided files are empty namespaces, so we need to add everything from scratch.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a Clock class in the namespace
2. The class should store minutes since midnight
3. Implement a constructor that takes hours and minutes
4. Implement methods to add and subtract minutes
5. Implement equality operators
6. Implement a toString() method to format the time as HH:MM

Wait, the instructions don't specify method names, but typically for C++ exercises, there are certain conventions.
Since the tests may expect specific interfaces, we need to be careful.

Let's implement:

Here are the necessary changes:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
=======
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

namespace date_independent {
    class clock {
    private:
        std::int32_t minutes_since_midnight;
        explicit clock(std::int32_t minutes);
    public:
        static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
        clock plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const;
        clock minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const;
        operator std::string() const;
        bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
        bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;
    };
}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in clock.cpp:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {
    clock::clock(std::int32_t minutes) : minutes_since_midnight(minutes) {
    }
    
    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        // Normalize to a valid number of minutes (0-1439)
        std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        // Handle negative values by adding enough days to make it positive
        total_minutes %= 1440;
        if (total_minutes < 0) {
            total_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(total_minutes);
    }
    
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes_to_add) const {
        return clock((minutes_since_midnight + minutes_to_add) % 1440);
    }
    
    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes_to_subtract) const {
        // To subtract, we can add negative minutes and handle the modulo
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (minutes_since_midnight - minutes_to_subtract) % 1440;
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }
    
    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = minutes_since_midnight / 60;
        std::int32_t minutes = minutes_since_midnight % 60;
        
        // Normalize hours to be between 0 and 23
        hours %= 24;
        if (hours < 0) {
            hours += 24;
        }
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << minutes;
        return oss.str();
    }
    
    bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
        return (minutes_since_midnight == other.minutes_since_midnight);
    }
    
    bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
        return !(*this == other);
    }
}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The plus and minus operations need to handle wrapping around correctly
2. We need to ensure that minutes_since_midnight is always between 0 and 1439
3. The implementation uses modulo 1440 (number of minutes in a day) to handle wrapping
4. When subtracting, we need to handle negative results by adding 1440 to make them positive

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
1. Add and subtract minutes
2. Two clocks representing the same time are equal (they have the same minutes_since_midnight)
3. Times are handled without dates

However, the implementation of the plus and minus methods needs to ensure that the result is always valid, which it does by using modulo arithmetic and adjusting for negative values.

This implementation should work, but let's test the logic:
- Adding 60 minutes to 23:00 (1380 minutes) would be 1440 % 1440 = 0 → 00:00 which is correct
- Subtracting 60 minutes from 00:00 (0 minutes) would be -60 % 1440 = -60 → which is adjusted to 1380 → 23:00 which is correct

This seems to work. Let's proceed with this implementation.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle the conversion to string properly and ensure all operations work correctly. Let's fix the implementation.

However, there's an issue: the `operator std::string() const` needs to be implemented to return a string, but the implementation may not be correct. Also, the implementation needs to ensure that the minutes are always valid.

Wait, the implementation in clock.cpp seems to have issues with handling negative values when adding and subtracting minutes. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary fixes:

1. The plus and minus operations need to handle wrapping correctly
2. The conversion to string needs to always show valid hours and minutes
3. The implementation needs to ensure that minutes_since_midnight is always between 0 and 1439

Here are the fixes:

    bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
        return (minutes_since_midnight != other.minutes_since_midnight);
    }
}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue: the constructor now normalizes the minutes, which ensures that all clock instances always have valid minutes_since_midnight values between 0 and 1439. This is good.

This implementation should now handle:
1. Adding and subtracting minutes correctly by leveraging the normalization in the constructor
2. Proper string conversion
3. Equality comparison based on normalized minutes

This should now work for all cases, including when adding or subtracting large numbers of minutes that cause multiple day wraparounds.

Let's test some cases:
1. clock::at(10, 0).plus(3) -> 10:03
2. clock::at(23, 59).plus(2) -> 00:01
3. clock::at(0, 1).minus(2) -> 23:59

All these will be handled by the normalization in the constructor, which ensures minutes are always between 0 and 1439.
