#### # Introduction  
####   
#### After years of filling out forms and waiting, you've finally acquired your banking license.  
#### This means you are now officially eligible to open your own bank, hurray!  
####   
#### Your first priority is to get the IT systems up and running.  
#### After a day of hard work, you can already open and close accounts, as well as handle withdrawals and deposits.  
####   
#### Since you couldn't be bothered writing tests, you invite some friends to help test the system.  
#### However, after just five minutes, one of your friends claims they've lost money!  
#### While you're confident your code is bug-free, you start looking through the logs to investigate.  
####   
#### Ah yes, just as you suspected, your friend is at fault!  
#### They shared their test credentials with another friend, and together they conspired to make deposits and withdrawals from the same account _in parallel_.  
#### Who would do such a thing?  
####   
#### While you argue that it's physically _impossible_ for someone to access their account in parallel, your friend smugly notifies you that the banking rules _require_ you to support this.  
#### Thus, no parallel banking support, no go-live signal.  
#### Sighing, you create a mental note to work on this tomorrow.  
#### This will set your launch date back at _least_ one more day, but well...  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
####   
#### As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), your bank software must allow accounts to be safely accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.  
#### For example, there may be many deposits and withdrawals occurring in parallel; you need to ensure there are no [race conditions][wikipedia] between when you read the account balance and set the new balance.  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
####   
#### [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.h bank_account.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a thread-safe bank account class that supports deposits, withdrawals, and account status (open/closed). Since operations need to be thread-safe, we'll need to use synchronization primitives to prevent race conditions.

Since this is C++, we can use a mutex to protect access to the account balance and status. Let's implement this properly.

First, let's update the header file to include necessary members and methods:

bank_account.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
=======
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <mutex>
#include <cstdint>

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {
private:
    std::int64_t balance_;
    bool is_open_;
    mutable std::mutex mutex_;
    
public:
    Bankaccount();
    void open();
    void close();
    void deposit(std::int64_t amount);
    void withdraw(std::int64_t amount);
    std::int64_t balance() const;
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these methods in the cpp file. We need to ensure all operations are thread-safe by using the mutex to protect access to the member variables:

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "bank_account.h"

namespace Bankaccount {}
=======
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : balance_(0), is_open_(false) {
}

void Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is already open");
    }
    is_open_ = true;
    balance_ = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is not open");
    }
    is_open_ = false;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    balance_ += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount > balance_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    balance_ -= amount;
}

std::int64_t Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    return balance_;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to ensure all operations check if the account is open
2. We need to throw appropriate exceptions when operations are invalid
3. All operations are protected by the mutex to ensure thread safety
4. We're using std::int64_t to represent amounts, which should be sufficient for banking operations

This implementation ensures that:
1. Multiple threads can safely access the account in parallel
2. All operations are atomic and won't interfere with each other
3. Closed accounts will reject all operations
4. Deposits and withdrawals are validated for positive amounts
5. Withdrawals check for sufficient funds

However, the instructions don't specify the exact interface, so I'm making some assumptions:
1. The account starts closed and needs to be explicitly opened
2. Opening an account sets the balance to 0
3. Closing an account makes all subsequent operations fail
4. The balance can be checked at any time when the account is open

This implementation should meet the requirements:
1. Thread-safe access to the account
2. Support for opening, closing, deposits, and withdrawals
3. Proper error handling for invalid operations
4. Prevention of race conditions through proper synchronization

Let me know if you need any adjustments!

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to comply with the MISRA C++ rules provided. The main issues are:
1. Using std::int64_t directly, which violates the rule about not using standard integer types
2. We need to use fixed-width types from <cstdint> with appropriate aliases

Let's fix this by creating an alias for the amount type and using it consistently. Also, we need to ensure all operations are properly parenthesized according to the rules.

Here are the necessary fixes:

bank_account.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <mutex>
#include <cstdint>

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {
private:
    std::int64_t balance_;
    bool is_open_;
    mutable std::mutex mutex_;
    
public:
    Bankaccount();
    void open();
    void close();
    void deposit(std::int64_t amount);
    void withdraw(std::int64_t amount);
    std::int64_t balance() const;
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
=======
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <mutex>
#include <cstdint>

namespace Bankaccount {

// Alias for amount type to comply with MISRA rules
using Amount = std::int64_t;

class Bankaccount {
private:
    Amount balance_;
    bool is_open_;
    mutable std::mutex mutex_;
    
public:
    Bankaccount();
    void open();
    void close();
    void deposit(Amount amount);
    void withdraw(Amount amount);
    Amount balance() const;
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's update the implementation to use the Amount alias and ensure all expressions are properly parenthesized:

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH

    }
    is_open_ = true;
    balance_ = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is not open");
    }
    is_open_ = false;
}

    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }

```

Key changes made:
1. Added an alias `Amount` for `std::int64_t` to comply with the rule about not using standard integer types directly
2. Updated all function signatures to use `Amount` instead of `std::int64_t`
3. Added parentheses around conditions to comply with the precedence rules:
   - `(amount <= 0)`
   - `(amount > balance_)`
4. Ensured all if statements have their bodies in compound statements (they already were)
5. Maintained thread safety with mutex locks

This implementation should now comply with the provided MISRA C++ rules while maintaining the required functionality:
1. Thread-safe access to the account
2. Proper handling of open/closed account status
3. Validation of deposit and withdrawal amounts
4. Prevention of withdrawals that would result in negative balance
5. Proper error handling through exceptions

Note: The implementation uses `std::lock_guard` which is appropriate for managing the mutex locks. All operations that access or modify the account state are properly synchronized to prevent race conditions.

I understand. The issue is that we're using `std::int64_t` directly, which violates the MISRA rule about not using standard integer types. We need to use fixed-width types from `<cstdint>` with appropriate aliases. However, `std::int64_t` is from `<cstdint>`, so there might be some confusion.

Wait, the rule says:
"The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used"
But `std::int64_t` is a fixed-width type, not a standard integer type like `int`, `long`, etc.

Perhaps the issue is that we need to use the fixed-width types directly without aliasing them? Or maybe the rule is being interpreted differently.

Actually, the rule says to use fixed-width types from `<cstdint>`, which is what we're doing. But it also says not to use their names directly, which is confusing. Let's re-read:
"Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long"
"Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, etc."

So `std::int64_t` should be fine, but we're using an alias `Amount` which is even better.

Wait, the error markers are on lines using `std::int64_t` and `std::mutex`. Maybe the issue is that we need to include the right headers and ensure all types are appropriate.

Actually, `std::mutex` might be the issue. Let's check if we need to include `<mutex>`.

Wait, it's already included. Maybe the issue is that we need to use the fixed-width types consistently.

Let's make sure all integer types are from `<cstdint>` and properly aliased. Let's fix the implementation:

Wait, the `Amount` alias uses `std::int64_t` which is from `<cstdint>`, which should be correct according to the rules.

Perhaps the issue is that the `balance()` function returns `Amount` which is an alias, and that's fine.

Wait, the markers are on:
1. `using Amount = std::int64_t;` - This should be fine per the rules
2. `mutable std::mutex mutex_;` - `std::mutex` is not an integer type, so it should be fine
3. `Amount balance() const;` - This uses the alias which is good

This seems correct. Maybe the markers are just highlighting these lines for review, not indicating errors.

Since the implementation seems correct according to the rules, I won't make changes unless there are specific errors to fix.

However, to be extra careful, let's ensure all conditions are properly parenthesized according to the rules:

Wait, in the implementation, we have:
`if ((amount <= 0))` - This has double parentheses which is unusual
`if ((amount > balance_))` - Same here

Let's fix those to use single, proper parentheses:

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
void Bankaccount::deposit(Amount amount) {
    if ((amount <= 0)) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");

    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    balance_ += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(Amount amount) {
    if ((amount <= 0)) {

        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if ((amount > balance_)) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");

    balance_ -= amount;

        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");

        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    balance_ -= amount;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, according to the rules, we need to parenthesize expressions when they are part of other operations. Since these are standalone conditions, they don't need extra parentheses beyond what's normal for if statements.

Wait, the rules say:
"Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level."
These conditions are not operands of other operators, so they're fine as is.

This implementation should now be correct and comply with the provided MISRA C++ rules. Let's proceed.
