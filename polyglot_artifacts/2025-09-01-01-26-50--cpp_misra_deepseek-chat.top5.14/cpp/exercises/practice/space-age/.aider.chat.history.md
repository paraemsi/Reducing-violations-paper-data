#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: space_age.cpp space_age.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a class that can calculate a person's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the age is given in seconds, and each planet has a different orbital period relative to Earth, we can calculate the age on each planet by:
1. First, calculate the age in Earth years: age_in_seconds / 31557600
2. Then, divide this by the orbital period of the target planet to get the age on that planet

However, the instructions mention that we need to implement this in a class, but the provided files are empty. Let's add the necessary implementation.

Since we need to be precise, we should use floating point numbers. Let's use double precision to ensure accuracy.

Wait, the instructions say to not change existing function or class names, but the namespace is empty. Maybe we need to implement a class within the space_age namespace.

Let's implement a class that takes the age in seconds in its constructor, and provides methods to get the age on each planet.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a class to space_age.h
2. Implement it in space_age.cpp
3. Each planet will have a method to get the age on that planet

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    double age_in_seconds_;
public:
    explicit space_age(double seconds);
    double seconds() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for space_age.cpp, we need to implement all these methods:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(double seconds) : age_in_seconds_(seconds) {}

double space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_in_seconds_;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return (age_in_seconds_ / 31557600.0);
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return (on_earth() / 0.2408467);
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return (on_earth() / 0.61519726);
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return (on_earth() / 1.8808158);
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return (on_earth() / 11.862615);
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return (on_earth() / 29.447498);
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return (on_earth() / 84.016846);
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return (on_earth() / 164.79132);
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, we need to ensure that all floating point operations are precise. Using double should be sufficient for this task.

This implementation follows the instructions:
1. We calculate the age in Earth years by dividing the number of seconds by 31557600
2. For other planets, we divide the Earth years by their orbital period to get the age on that planet
3. Each planet has its own method to get the age

This should satisfy the requirements. Let's test this approach with the example:
1,000,000,000 seconds should be 31.69 Earth years, which matches:
1,000,000,000 / 31,557,600 ≈ 31.68808781402895

Wait, the note says 31,557,600 seconds per Earth year, which matches our implementation.

I understand. The implementation needs to be precise, and we need to ensure that all floating point operations are accurate. Let's use precise values to avoid any rounding errors.

However, the implementation looks correct. Let's test the provided example:
1,000,000,000 seconds should be 31.69 Earth years:
1,000,000,000 / 31,557,600 ≈ 31.68808781402895

But the note says 31.69, which suggests we might need to round to two decimal places? But the instructions don't specify precision requirements.

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but perhaps the issue is with floating point precision. Let's use exact values from the table.

Actually, the implementation looks fine. Maybe the issue is that the tests expect specific precision. Let's make sure we're using the exact values provided.

Wait, the Earth year in seconds is 31,557,600, which matches:
365.25 days/year * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 31,557,600 seconds/year

This seems correct. Let's see if there are any other issues.

Perhaps the issue is that we need to use the exact orbital periods from the table, which we are doing.

Wait, the implementation uses on_earth() in other methods, which could accumulate floating point errors. But this should be fine with double precision.

Let's make sure all numbers are precise by using literals with sufficient digits.

Actually, the implementation seems correct. Maybe the issue is that the tests expect the age in seconds to be stored as an integer, not a double? But the instructions say "age in seconds", which could be fractional.

Wait, the class interface uses double, which is appropriate.

Perhaps the issue is that the seconds() method should return the exact age in seconds that was passed to the constructor, which it does.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the errors are from other parts of the code not shown.

Since I can't see any actual errors, I'll assume the implementation is correct and matches the requirements.

However, to be thorough, let's ensure all floating point operations are precise by using the exact values from the instructions:

Wait, the implementation uses:
31557600.0 which is correct
All the orbital periods match the table

This seems correct. If there are specific errors, I'd need to see them to fix them.

Since I can't see any actual errors, I'll provide the implementation as is, which should be correct.

However, to make sure, let's use precise values and avoid potential floating point issues by performing divisions directly:

Wait, to minimize floating point errors, we could compute each planet's age directly:
age_on_planet = age_in_seconds / (31557600 * orbital_period)

But this is mathematically equivalent to age_in_seconds / 31557600 / orbital_period
So it shouldn't matter.

Since I don't see any actual errors, I'll assume the implementation is correct.

If there are specific test cases failing, I'd need to know what they are to fix them.
