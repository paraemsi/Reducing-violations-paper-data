#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given any two lists `A` and `B`, determine if:  
####   
#### - List `A` is equal to list `B`; or  
#### - List `A` contains list `B` (`A` is a superlist of `B`); or  
#### - List `A` is contained by list `B` (`A` is a sublist of `B`); or  
#### - None of the above is true, thus lists `A` and `B` are unequal  
####   
#### Specifically, list `A` is equal to list `B` if both lists have the same values in the same order.  
#### List `A` is a superlist of `B` if `A` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `B`.  
#### List `A` is a sublist of `B` if `B` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `A`.  
####   
#### Examples:  
####   
#### - If `A = []` and `B = []` (both lists are empty), then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = []`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = []` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4, 5]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `B = [2, 3, 4]`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 3, 2]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
####

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: sublist.h sublist.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
