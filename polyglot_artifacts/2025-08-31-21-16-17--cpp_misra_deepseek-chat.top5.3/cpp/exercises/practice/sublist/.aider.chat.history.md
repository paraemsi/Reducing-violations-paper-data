#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given any two lists `A` and `B`, determine if:  
####   
#### - List `A` is equal to list `B`; or  
#### - List `A` contains list `B` (`A` is a superlist of `B`); or  
#### - List `A` is contained by list `B` (`A` is a sublist of `B`); or  
#### - None of the above is true, thus lists `A` and `B` are unequal  
####   
#### Specifically, list `A` is equal to list `B` if both lists have the same values in the same order.  
#### List `A` is a superlist of `B` if `A` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `B`.  
#### List `A` is a sublist of `B` if `B` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `A`.  
####   
#### Examples:  
####   
#### - If `A = []` and `B = []` (both lists are empty), then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = []`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = []` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4, 5]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `B = [2, 3, 4]`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 3, 2]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: sublist.h sublist.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

I understand. Let's implement a function to determine the relationship between two lists. Since we're working with C++, we'll use vectors to represent the lists. We need to implement a function that can check for equality, sublist, superlist, or none of these relationships.

Since the instructions don't specify the exact function signature, I'll assume we need to implement a function that takes two vectors and returns an enum or something similar. Let's define an enumeration to represent the possible relationships.

Wait, the files are empty, so we need to define everything from scratch.

First, let's define the enum in the header file, and then implement the comparison function.

Here's the plan:
1. Check if A and B are equal
2. Check if A is a sublist of B
3. Check if A is a superlist of B
4. Otherwise, return unequal

To check if A is a sublist of B, we can check if B contains A as a contiguous subsequence
Since the lists can be empty, we need to handle those cases properly

Here are the necessary changes:

sublist.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#pragma once

namespace sublist {

}  // namespace sublist
=======
#pragma once
#include <vector>

namespace sublist {

enum class ListComparison {
    equal,
    sublist,
    superlist,
    unequal
};

ListComparison compare(const std::vector<int>& list1, const std::vector<int>& list2);

}  // namespace sublist
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the comparison function in sublist.cpp:

sublist.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "sublist.h"

namespace sublist {

}  // namespace sublist
=======
#include "sublist.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

namespace sublist {

ListComparison compare(const std::vector<int>& list1, const std::vector<int>& list2) {
    // Check if equal
    if (list1 == list2) {
        return ListComparison::equal;
    }
    
    // Check if list1 is a sublist of list2
    if (list1.size() <= list2.size()) {
        for (size_t i = 0; i <= (list2.size() - list1.size()); i++) {
            bool found = true;
            for (size_t j = 0; j < list1.size(); j++) {
                if (list2[i + j] != list1[j]) {
                    found = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (found) {
                return ListComparison::sublist;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Check if list1 is a superlist of list2 (list2 is a sublist of list1)
    if (list1.size() >= list2.size()) {
        for (size_t i = 0; i <= (list1.size() - list2.size()); i++) {
            bool found = true;
            for (size_t j = 0; j < list2.size(); j++) {
                if (list1[i + j] != list2[j]) {
                    found = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (found) {
                return ListComparison::superlist;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return ListComparison::unequal;
}

}  // namespace sublist
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, we need to handle cases where the lists are empty:
- If list1 is empty and list2 is not empty, list1 is a sublist of list2
- If list2 is empty and list1 is not empty, list1 is a superlist of list2
- If both are empty, they're equal (handled by the first condition)

But our implementation should handle these cases correctly:
- When list1 is empty, the loop to check if it's a sublist of list2 will always find it (since i ranges from 0 to list2.size() which is >=0)
- Similarly, when list2 is empty, the loop to check if list2 is a sublist of list1 will always find it

Wait, but the implementation needs to be adjusted to handle these cases:
- If list1 is empty, it's always a sublist of list2, but we need to check if list2 is also empty (which would make them equal)
- Since we check for equality first, which would catch both being empty, we're good

This implementation should work for all the provided examples:
- A = [] and B = [] → equal (first condition)
- A = [1, 2, 3] and B = [] → A is superlist of B (list2 is empty, so the second part of the implementation will find that list2 is a sublist of list1)
- A = [] and B = [1, 2, 3] → A is sublist of B (list1 is empty, so the first part will find that list1 is a sublist of list2)
- etc.

This implementation should be correct. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to follow the MISRA C++ rules provided. Let's fix the issues:

1. We need to include <cstdint> and use fixed-width integer types
2. Add proper parentheses to expressions
3. Add braces to all if/else statements
4. Ensure no character to integer conversions

However, since we're dealing with sizes, which are typically size_t, and indices, we need to be careful about integer types.
But according to the rules, we shouldn't use basic integer types directly. Let's use std::uint64_t for indices and sizes.

Wait, the standard library uses size_t, which may conflict with the rules. But since we're not declaring our own types, and we're using the standard library, we need to be careful.
The rules say not to use standard integer types, but the standard library uses size_t. This might be tricky.

Since the rules are about not using the standard signed/unsigned integer types in our own declarations, and we need to use fixed-width types, we'll use std::uint64_t for our loop variables.

Let's fix the implementation:

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to cast the sizes to std::uint64_t to avoid mixing types
2. We need to ensure that the comparisons are valid
3. We need to add parentheses where necessary according to the rules

But the implementation looks correct. Let's test the logic:
- When list1 is empty and list2 is not empty, list1.size() is 0 which is <= list2.size()
  The loop runs from i=0 to i <= list2.size() - 0, which is valid
  The inner loop runs from j=0 to j < 0, which doesn't run, so found remains true
  Thus, we return sublist, which matches the requirement

- When list2 is empty and list1 is not empty, the first condition (equality) is false
  Then we check if list1.size() <= list2.size() which is false (since list1.size() > 0 and list2.size() == 0)
  Then we check if list1.size() >= list2.size() which is true
  The loop runs from i=0 to i <= list1.size() - 0
  The inner loop runs from j=0 to j < 0, which doesn't run, so found remains true
  Thus, we return superlist, which matches the requirement

This implementation should work correctly. Let's proceed.

However, there's a potential issue when list1.size() or list2.size() is larger than what can fit in std::uint64_t, but that's highly unlikely in practice. Also, we need to ensure that when list1 is empty, the condition (list2_size - list1_size) is valid, which it is.

This implementation should now follow the MISRA C++ rules:
1. Using fixed-width integer types
2. Adding parentheses where necessary
3. All if statements have compound bodies
4. No mixing of integer types

Let's also make sure to add parentheses around the addition in the index expressions to be extra careful, though according to the rules, addition and subtraction have the same precedence and associate left-to-right, so they don't need parentheses when used together. But to be consistent, we'll add them:

Wait, the rules say to always parenthesize when operators have different precedence levels. Since + has higher precedence than !=, we should add parentheses:

Wait, but the rules say:
"Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level."

So list2[i + j] != list1[j] should be (list2[(i + j)]) != list1[j]

But actually, the index operator [] has higher precedence than !=, so it's fine. But to be precise, let's add parentheses:

Wait, the rules may require parentheses around (i + j) to make it clear:

Wait, the rules say to always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in other expressions. So we should write:
list2[(i + j)] != list1[j]

But this seems to violate the character usage rule, but since we're indexing into vectors of integers, it's fine.

Actually, the implementation should be correct as is. Let's proceed.

I understand. The tests are expecting a function called `sublist` that returns a `List_comparison` enum, but our implementation provides a `compare` function that returns a `ListComparison` enum. Let's fix this.

Here are the necessary changes:

This change renames:
1. `ListComparison` to `List_comparison` to match the test expectations
2. `compare` to `sublist` to match the function name used in the tests

Now the implementation should work with the provided tests. Let's hope this resolves the compilation errors.

The implementation looks correct, but we need to handle cases where the size difference could lead to underflow when subtracting. For example, when list2_size is less than list1_size, (list2_size - list1_size) would underflow, but since we're checking if (list1.size() <= list2.size()) first, this should never happen. However, to be extra careful, let's make sure.

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but let's add some parentheses to ensure operator precedence according to the rules:

Wait, the rules say to always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in other expressions. Let's add parentheses around (i + j) in the indexing operations:

This change adds:
1. Parentheses around (i + j) to ensure proper operator precedence
2. Casts to std::size_t when indexing into vectors to avoid potential type issues

However, the implementation should now be correct and follow the MISRA C++ rules. Let's hope this resolves any remaining issues.
