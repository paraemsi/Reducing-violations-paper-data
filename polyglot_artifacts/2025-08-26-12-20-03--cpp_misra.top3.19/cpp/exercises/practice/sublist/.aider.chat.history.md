#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given any two lists `A` and `B`, determine if:  
####   
#### - List `A` is equal to list `B`; or  
#### - List `A` contains list `B` (`A` is a superlist of `B`); or  
#### - List `A` is contained by list `B` (`A` is a sublist of `B`); or  
#### - None of the above is true, thus lists `A` and `B` are unequal  
####   
#### Specifically, list `A` is equal to list `B` if both lists have the same values in the same order.  
#### List `A` is a superlist of `B` if `A` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `B`.  
#### List `A` is a sublist of `B` if `B` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `A`.  
####   
#### Examples:  
####   
#### - If `A = []` and `B = []` (both lists are empty), then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = []`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = []` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4, 5]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `B = [2, 3, 4]`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 3, 2]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: sublist.h sublist.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>
