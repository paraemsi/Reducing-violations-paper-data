#### # Introduction  
####   
#### After years of filling out forms and waiting, you've finally acquired your banking license.  
#### This means you are now officially eligible to open your own bank, hurray!  
####   
#### Your first priority is to get the IT systems up and running.  
#### After a day of hard work, you can already open and close accounts, as well as handle withdrawals and deposits.  
####   
#### Since you couldn't be bothered writing tests, you invite some friends to help test the system.  
#### However, after just five minutes, one of your friends claims they've lost money!  
#### While you're confident your code is bug-free, you start looking through the logs to investigate.  
####   
#### Ah yes, just as you suspected, your friend is at fault!  
#### They shared their test credentials with another friend, and together they conspired to make deposits and withdrawals from the same account _in parallel_.  
#### Who would do such a thing?  
####   
#### While you argue that it's physically _impossible_ for someone to access their account in parallel, your friend smugly notifies you that the banking rules _require_ you to support this.  
#### Thus, no parallel banking support, no go-live signal.  
#### Sighing, you create a mental note to work on this tomorrow.  
#### This will set your launch date back at _least_ one more day, but well...  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
####   
#### As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), your bank software must allow accounts to be safely accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.  
#### For example, there may be many deposits and withdrawals occurring in parallel; you need to ensure there are no [race conditions][wikipedia] between when you read the account balance and set the new balance.  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
####   
#### [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.cpp bank_account.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:  
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of  
####   `if (x) doSomething();`  
####   write  
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.  
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).  
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.  
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.  
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.  
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.  
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
####   
####   
#### The argument and the parameter of a function call should have the same type if the parameter is not overload-independent  
#### - Pass exactly the same numeric type as the parameter expects; never rely on implicit numeric conversions.  
#### - You may omit the cast only when the argument is overload-independent:  
####   • the call is through a pointer-to-function / pointer-to-member, or  
####   • the call is to a non-extensible member / function-object AND every overload uses that same type for that argument.  
#### - Otherwise, make the conversion explicit: static_cast<param_type>(arg).  
#### - Do not let overloaded member functions accept different numeric types in the same parameter position; unify the type or cast at the call-site.  
#### - Free/namespace functions are extensible: always pass the exact numeric type or add an overload.  
#### - Single-numeric-argument constructors may accept a different numeric type only if no other single-arg constructors exist (besides copy/move); all other constructors follow the normal rule.  
#### - cv-qualifiers, references, and typedefs are ignored when comparing types—match the underlying numeric type.  
#### - Example: instead of f(shortVal); use f(static_cast<int>(shortVal)); unless an f(short) overload is guaranteed to exist.  
####   
####   
#### The value returned by a function having a non-void return type that is not an overloaded operator shall always be used  
#### - Always use the return value of any non-void function (store, pass, compare, etc.).  
#### - If the value is intentionally ignored, explicitly discard it with a cast: `(void)func();`.  
#### - Never leave a bare call to a non-void function like `func();` without the `(void)` cast.  
#### - Overloaded operator calls are exempt; treat them like built-in operators.  
####   
####   
#### The character handling functions from <cctype> and <cwctype> shall not be used  
#### - Do NOT include <cctype>, <ctype.h>, <cwctype>, <wctype.h>  
#### - Do NOT call, reference, or take addresses of isalnum/alpha/blank/cntrl/digit/graph/lower/print/punct/space/upper/xdigit, tolower/toupper, or any isw…/tow…/wc… variants  
#### - Use locale-aware overloads from <locale> instead, e.g. `std::isalnum(ch, std::locale{})`, `std::tolower(ch, loc)`  
#### - If locale support is unnecessary, create your own constexpr helpers that accept only unsigned-char values  
#### - Always pass a valid `std::locale` to the <locale> functions to avoid undefined behavior and stay compliant  
####   
####   
#### Integral promotion and the usual arithmetic conversions shall not change the signedness or the type category of an operand  
#### - Do not rely on implicit integral promotion or usual arithmetic conversions in expressions; they must not change operand signedness or type category.  
#### - Before any arithmetic, bitwise, or relational operation, ensure all operands already share the same signedness and are all‐integral or all‐floating.  
####   ‑ Example: instead of `u8a + u8b`, write `static_cast<uint32_t>(u8a) + u8b`.  
#### - Never mix signed and unsigned operands without an explicit cast to a common signedness.  
####   ‑ Example: instead of `s32 > u32`, write `static_cast<int64_t>(s32) > static_cast<int64_t>(u32)`.  
#### - Never mix integral and floating operands without first casting the integral value to the required floating type.  
####   ‑ Example: instead of `f32 += u32`, write `f32 += static_cast<float>(u32)`.  
#### - For compound assignments (`+=`, `-=`, etc.) apply the same rule: cast the right-hand operand so no implicit promotion is needed.  
#### - Increment/decrement on a small integral type is allowed with no extra cast.  
#### - Comparisons where both operands already have exactly the same type are allowed.  
#### - It is acceptable to convert:  
####   ‑ a non-negative signed integer literal to an unsigned type, or  
####   ‑ any integral literal to a floating type.  
####   
####   
#### Symmetrical operators should only be implemented as non-member functions  
#### - Do NOT implement binary operators +, -, *, /, %, ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=, ^, &, |, &&, || as class member functions.  
#### - Instead, define them as non-member (free) functions; make them `friend` if private access is required.  
#### - Signature pattern: `friend RetType operatorOP(const Class& lhs, const Class& rhs);` (both operands explicit).  
#### - Convert any existing member definitions of the listed operators to non-member (friend) form to ensure symmetrical conversions.  
#### </rules>
