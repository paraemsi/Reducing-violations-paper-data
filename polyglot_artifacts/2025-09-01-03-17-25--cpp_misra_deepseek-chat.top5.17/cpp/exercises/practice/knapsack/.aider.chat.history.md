#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a fancy store.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value and weight.  
#### Bob would gladly take all of the items, but his knapsack can only hold so much weight.  
#### Bob has to carefully consider which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to determine which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized, taking into account the knapsack's carrying capacity.  
####   
#### Items will be represented as a list of items.  
#### Each item will have a weight and value.  
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10  
#### ```  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.cpp knapsack.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a function to solve the classic 0/1 knapsack problem, where we want to maximize the total value without exceeding the maximum weight capacity. Since we can only take each item once, this is a dynamic programming problem.

Since the instructions mention that the function names should not be changed, but none are provided, I need to add a function to the namespace. Let's add a function that takes a list of items and a maximum weight, and returns the maximum value.

However, the problem may require returning the actual items or just the maximum value. Since the example says "Bob should take the second and fourth item", it might be about the selection, but the instruction says "the total value of his selection is maximized". Let's assume we need to return the maximum value.

Wait, the example says "Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90" which suggests we need to find the maximum value, not the items themselves.

Let's implement a function to compute the maximum value using dynamic programming.

Since weights can be up to the maximum weight, which could be large, we need to be efficient. But the constraints aren't specified, so we'll implement a standard approach.

However, to follow the MISRA rules, we need to be careful with types. Let's use std::int32_t from <cstdint>.

Here's the plan:
1. Add necessary includes
2. Implement a function to compute maximum value
3. Since all values are positive, we can use dynamic programming where dp[i] = maximum value with weight i

Here are the necessary changes:

First, let's update the header to declare the function:

knapsack.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    int weight;
    int value;
};

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
=======
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    std::int32_t weight;
    std::int32_t value;
};

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items);

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the function in the cpp file:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"

namespace knapsack
{

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty())
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i] is the maximum value with weight i
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process from the end
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in dp array
    std::int32_t max_value = 0;
    for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximum_weight; ++w)
    {
        if (dp[w] > max_value)
        {
            max_value = dp[w];
        }
    }
    
    return max_value;
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation uses dynamic programming where dp[w] represents the maximum value achievable with weight w. We process each item and update the dp array from the maximum weight down to the item's weight to ensure each item is only used once.

However, to follow the MISRA rules:
1. All types are std::int32_t
2. We use braces for all if statements
3. We're careful with operations
4. We include necessary headers

This should work for the provided example:
Items: [
  { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },
  { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }
]
Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10

Processing:
- For item 1 (5, 10): Update weights 10-5
- For item 2 (4, 40): Update weights 10-4
- etc.

The maximum value should be 90, which matches the example.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle cases where the maximum weight is 0, and to ensure all operations are valid. Let's fix the implementation:

1. The weight and value should be non-negative, which they are according to the instructions
2. We need to make sure we don't access negative indices
3. We need to follow MISRA rules

Here are the necessary fixes:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty())
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i] is the maximum value with weight i
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process from the end
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in dp array
    std::int32_t max_value = 0;
    for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximum_weight; ++w)
    {
        if (dp[w] > max_value)
        {
            max_value = dp[w];
        }
    }
    
    return max_value;
}

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if ((maximum_weight <= 0) || (items.empty()))
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i] is the maximum value with weight i
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(static_cast<std::size_t>(maximum_weight) + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process from the end
        // Make sure to use the correct type for the loop variable
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= 0; --w)
        {
            if (item.weight <= w)
            {
                const std::int32_t candidate = dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w - item.weight)] + item.value;
                if (candidate > dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)])
                {
                    dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)] = candidate;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(maximum_weight)];
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to make sure we don't access negative indices, which is handled by checking if item.weight <= w
2. We always process from maximum_weight down to 0
3. We use static_cast to convert between integer types when indexing into the vector
4. The maximum value will always be at dp[maximum_weight] because we're always trying to maximize within the weight constraint

This implementation should work correctly. Let's test it with the provided example:
Items: [
  { weight: 5, value: 10 },
  { weight: 4, value: 40 },
  { weight: 6, value: 30 },
  { weight: 4, value: 50 }
]
Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10

Processing:
1. After processing all items, dp[10] should be 90 (40 + 50)

Wait, but sometimes the maximum value might not be at maximum_weight if the items don't exactly fill the knapsack.
But in our implementation, we always try to maximize the value for each weight, and since values are positive, the maximum value should be at the maximum weight.
Actually, that's not always true. For example, if all items have weight greater than maximum_weight, then all dp[w] will be 0.
But in that case, dp[maximum_weight] will be correct.

Wait, the initial implementation found the maximum across all weights, which is more correct.
Let's fix that:

Wait, to find the maximum value across all weights up to maximum_weight, we can simply take the last element of the dp array if we always maximize.
But actually, since we're always updating, the maximum value should be at the highest index that can be achieved.
But to be safe, we can find the maximum in the dp array.

Wait, the problem says Bob's knapsack can only hold up to maximum_weight, so any weight beyond that is not allowed.
So the maximum value is the maximum among all dp[w] where w <= maximum_weight, which is exactly what we have in our dp array.
Since we're filling up to maximum_weight, we can find the maximum value in the entire dp array.

Wait, but to optimize, we can track the maximum value during the process or at the end.
Let's find the maximum at the end:

Wait, but to follow the initial approach, let's find the maximum in the dp array:

Wait, but to be efficient, we can do:

But to follow the instructions, let's modify:

Wait, the implementation above always returns dp[maximum_weight], which may not always be correct.
For example, if maximum_weight is 10, and we have items with weight 8 (value 100) and weight 8 (value 100), then dp[10] would be 100, but dp[8] would be 100, which is correct.
But if we have weight 6 (value 50) and weight 6 (value 50), then dp[12] is beyond our array, but we only go up to 10, so dp[10] would be 50 + 50? No, we can't take both if their total weight is 12 which is > 10.
So dp[10] would be max(50, 50) = 50, which is correct.

Actually, the maximum value is always at dp[maximum_weight] in the standard knapsack solution.
So our implementation is correct.

Wait, but to be sure, let's always find the maximum value in the dp array:

Wait, the initial implementation had a loop to find the maximum, which is more correct.
Let's add that back:

Here's the final fix:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(maximum_weight)];
=======
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    std::int32_t max_value = 0;
    for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximum_weight; ++w)
    {
        if (dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)] > max_value)
        {
            max_value = dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)];
        }
    }
    return max_value;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This ensures we always get the maximum value even if it's not at the maximum weight index.
