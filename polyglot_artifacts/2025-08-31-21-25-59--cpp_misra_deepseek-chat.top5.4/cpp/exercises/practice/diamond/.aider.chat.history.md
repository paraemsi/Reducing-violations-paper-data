#### # Instructions  
####   
#### The diamond kata takes as its input a letter, and outputs it in a diamond shape.  
#### Given a letter, it prints a diamond starting with 'A', with the supplied letter at the widest point.  
####   
#### ## Requirements  
####   
#### - The first row contains one 'A'.  
#### - The last row contains one 'A'.  
#### - All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.  
#### - All rows have as many trailing spaces as leading spaces. (This might be 0).  
#### - The diamond is horizontally symmetric.  
#### - The diamond is vertically symmetric.  
#### - The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).  
#### - The letters form a diamond shape.  
#### - The top half has the letters in ascending order.  
#### - The bottom half has the letters in descending order.  
#### - The four corners (containing the spaces) are triangles.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### In the following examples, spaces are indicated by `·` characters.  
####   
#### Diamond for letter 'A':  
####   
#### ```text  
#### A  
#### ```  
####   
#### Diamond for letter 'C':  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ··A··  
#### ·B·B·  
#### C···C  
#### ·B·B·  
#### ··A··  
#### ```  
####   
#### Diamond for letter 'E':  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ····A····  
#### ···B·B···  
#### ··C···C··  
#### ·D·····D·  
#### E·······E  
#### ·D·····D·  
#### ··C···C··  
#### ···B·B···  
#### ····A····  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: diamond.cpp diamond.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

I need to implement a function that generates a diamond pattern based on an input letter. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the implementation needs to be in C++, and we need to follow the given rules, we need to be careful about types and operations.

The diamond should be generated for a given letter, which will be between 'A' and 'Z'. The implementation needs to:
1. Determine the size of the diamond based on the input letter
2. Generate each row of the diamond
3. Ensure proper spacing and letter placement

Since the diamond is always square, its size will be 2*(letter - 'A') + 1
But according to the rules, we can't use numerical values of characters directly, so we need to find another way.

Wait, the rules say we can't use numerical values of characters, but we can use equality comparisons. So we need to find a way to work with letters without treating them as numbers.

However, to generate the diamond, we need to know the index of the letter in the alphabet. Since we can't subtract 'A' to get an index, we need to find another approach.

Actually, the problem might be tricky under these constraints. Let's think about generating each row by knowing which letter should be at each position.

Since the diamond is always symmetric, we can generate the top half and mirror it to get the bottom half.

But to index properly, we need to know the distance from 'A'. Maybe we can use a lookup table or something.

Wait, the rules say we can't use numerical values, but perhaps we can use an array of letters and find the index through iteration:
['A', 'B', 'C', ... 'Z']

But this seems to be allowed since we're only using equality comparisons to find the index.

Now, let's implement the function to return a vector of strings, each representing a line of the diamond.

Wait, the function signature isn't specified. Since this is a kata, it's probably:
std::vector<std::string> make_diamond(char letter)

But the files are empty, so we need to define this function.

Here's the plan:
1. Find the index of the target letter in the alphabet
2. The size of the diamond is 2 * index + 1
3. For each row, determine which letter to place and where
4. The top and bottom are symmetric

However, we need to be careful with the rules:
- No numerical operations on characters
- Always use braces
- Parenthesize expressions properly

Let's implement:

Wait, first, we need to include necessary headers and define the function signature.

Here are the necessary changes:

diamond.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#pragma once

namespace diamond {

}  // namespace diamond
=======
#pragma once
#include <string>
#include <vector>

namespace diamond {

std::vector<std::string> make_diamond(char letter);

}  // namespace diamond
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in diamond.cpp:

diamond.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "diamond.h"

namespace diamond {

}  // namespace diamond
=======
#include "diamond.h"
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

namespace diamond {

std::vector<std::string> make_diamond(char letter) {
    // First, find which letter we're dealing with by building a list of all letters
    const char letters[] = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
    
    // Find the index of the target letter
    std::int32_t target_index = 0;
    for (std::int32_t i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (letters[i] == letter) {
            target_index = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // The size of the diamond is always odd: 2 * target_index + 1
    std::int32_t size = (2 * target_index) + 1;
    std::vector<std::string> diamond;
    
    // Generate each row
    for (std::int32_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        std::string row(size, ' ');
        
        // Determine which letter to place in this row
        // The distance from the middle row
        std::int32_t distance_from_center = (i <= target_index) ? i : (size - 1 - i);
        char current_letter = letters[distance_from_center];
        
        // Calculate positions to place the letters
        std::int32_t left_pos = target_index - distance_from_center;
        std::int32_t right_pos = target_index + distance_from_center;
        
        // Place the letters
        row[left_pos] = current_letter;
        row[right_pos] = current_letter;
        
        diamond.push_back(row);
    }
    
    return diamond;
}

}  // namespace diamond
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We're using std::int32_t which follows the rules
2. We're not doing numerical operations on characters directly
3. We're using equality comparisons to find the index
4. All if statements have braces
5. We're properly parenthesizing expressions

This implementation should work for generating the diamond pattern:
- For 'A', target_index is 0, size is 1
- For 'C', target_index is 2, size is 5
- The rows are generated by placing letters at the appropriate positions

However, let's test the logic:
- The distance from center helps determine which letter to use
- The positions are calculated based on the target index and distance from center

This should produce the correct diamond shapes as per the examples:
- 'A' is just "A"
- 'C' has the pattern described

This implementation follows all the given rules while solving the problem. Let's proceed with this approach.

I understand. The issue is that we need to include the `<string>` header in `diamond.h` to use `std::string`, and we need to include `<vector>` to use `std::vector`. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary fixes:

diamond.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#pragma once
#include <string>
#include <vector>

namespace diamond {

std::vector<std::string> make_diamond(char letter);

}  // namespace diamond
=======
#pragma once
#include <string>
#include <vector>

namespace diamond {

std::vector<std::string> make_diamond(char letter);

}  // namespace diamond
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Wait, the includes are already there. Maybe the error is about something else. Let's look at the implementation.

Actually, the implementation seems correct, but perhaps there's an issue with the way we're handling the letter 'A'. Let's test our implementation:
For 'A', target_index is 0, size is 1
distance_from_center will always be 0
left_pos and right_pos will both be 0
So we set row[0] to 'A' twice, which is fine
This produces a single character string "A"

This matches the requirement:
Diamond for letter 'A':
A

Wait, but the implementation seems correct. Maybe the error is about something else.

Perhaps the issue is that we need to ensure all if statements have braces. Let's check:
The ternary operator is used, which might not be ideal, but it's not an if statement
Wait, the rules say:
"The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement"
This doesn't apply to ternary operators

Wait, the implementation uses a ternary operator which might be fine, but let's make sure all if statements have braces:
The for loop has an if statement which does have braces

Wait, perhaps the issue is that we need to use parentheses in expressions:
Let's add parentheses to ensure proper precedence

Wait, the implementation seems to follow the rules:
1. We're using fixed-width integer types
2. We're not doing numerical operations on characters
3. All if statements have braces
4. We're using appropriate assignments

Wait, the error marker is on the function declaration in diamond.h
Perhaps the issue is that the function needs to be declared in a certain way
But it looks correct

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the implementation needs to be more precise about the rules:
"The numerical value of a character shall not be used"
We're using letters[i] == letter which is an equality comparison, which is allowed
But we're indexing into an array with i, which is fine

Wait, perhaps the implementation needs to be adjusted to not use the index to get the current_letter
But that seems tricky

Actually, let's reimplement to be more careful:
Instead of using an index to get the letter, we can generate the letters in order
But we need to know which letter to use for each row

Wait, the distance from center can be used to know which letter to use, which is 'A' + distance
But this would violate the rule about not using numerical values of characters
So we need to find another way

Let's precompute all the letters we need to use:
Since the maximum is 'A' to the input letter, we can build a list of these letters
Then use their indices

But we need to be careful to not do arithmetic on characters

Here's a revised approach:
1. Build a list of letters from 'A' up to the input letter
2. The number of rows is 2 * n + 1 where n is the index of the input letter in this list
3. For each row, determine which letter to use based on its distance from the center
4. Get the letter from the list using the index, which is valid since we're not doing character arithmetic

Wait, but to build the list, we need to know how to generate the sequence 'A', 'B', ..., up to letter
Without using character arithmetic

We can do this by having a fixed string of all letters and finding where to stop
Which is what we're already doing

Actually, our implementation seems correct
Perhaps the error is elsewhere

Wait, the implementation uses:
char current_letter = letters[distance_from_center];
This is fine because we're indexing into an array, not doing character arithmetic

Perhaps the issue is that the function needs to be declared differently
But the declaration seems correct

Wait, the error is in diamond.h, line 7
Perhaps there's a missing include
But both <string> and <vector> are included

Let's make sure all necessary includes are present
Wait, the implementation in diamond.cpp includes <cstdint> which is good

Perhaps the issue is that the function needs to be declared with the exact types
But it seems correct

I think the implementation is correct, and the error might be from something else
Let's proceed with the current implementation

Since the user says there's an error, and it's marked on line 7, perhaps there's a syntax error
But it looks correct

Wait, perhaps the function needs to be exported differently
But in C++, this looks fine

I think we should proceed, as the implementation seems correct and follows all the rules
If there are specific errors, we'll need more information to address them

I see. The issue might be that the function declaration is correct, but perhaps there's a problem with the implementation. Let's carefully review the implementation to ensure it follows all the rules, especially regarding character handling.

The rules say:
- Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (<, >, <=, >=), logical, or boolean-context expressions
- Equality comparisons == / != between operands of the same character type are permitted

In our implementation, we're using:
1. `letters[i] == letter` - This is an equality comparison between chars, which is allowed
2. `char current_letter = letters[distance_from_center]` - This is indexing into an array, which is fine
3. We're not doing any arithmetic on characters

Wait, but the implementation seems correct. Let's make sure all expressions are properly parenthesized according to the rules:
- Always parenthesize binary or ternary sub-expressions when they are operands of another operator
- The ternary operator needs to be parenthesized if it's part of a larger expression

Wait, the implementation uses:
std::int32_t distance_from_center = (i <= target_index) ? i : (size - 1 - i);
This needs to be checked for proper parentheses

Also, the rules say to always use braces for if/else, but this is a ternary operator, which is different

Wait, perhaps we should avoid the ternary operator and use if-else instead to be safer
But the rules don't forbid ternary operators, just that their operands need to be properly parenthesized

Let's fix any potential issues:

1. Add parentheses to ensure proper precedence
2. Make sure all if statements have braces
3. Ensure no character arithmetic

Here's the revised implementation:

```

This implementation:
1. Replaces the ternary operator with if-else statements which always use braces
2. Ensures all operations are on integers, not characters
3. Uses only equality comparisons for characters, which is allowed
4. Properly parenthesizes expressions where necessary

However, the error is still pointing to the function declaration in diamond.h. Let's make sure the function signature is correct. Since the implementation seems to follow all the rules, perhaps there's an issue with how the function is being used or tested.

Wait, the function is declared to return `std::vector<std::string>`, which matches the implementation. The includes are present. This should be correct.

Perhaps the error is from a different part of the codebase that we can't see. Since we can only modify the provided files, and our implementation seems correct, we'll proceed.

If there are further issues, we may need more information about the specific error being encountered.

I understand. The tests are calling a function named `rows`, but our implementation provides `make_diamond`. We need to rename our function to match what the tests expect. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

    const char letters[] = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
    
    // Find the index of the target letter using only equality comparisons
    std::int32_t target_index = 0;
    for (std::int32_t i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (letters[i] == letter) {
            target_index = i;
            break;
        }
    }

        }
        
        // Get the corresponding letter
        char current_letter = letters[distance_from_center];
        
        // Calculate positions
        std::int32_t left_pos = target_index - distance_from_center;
        std::int32_t right_pos = target_index + distance_from_center;

        row[right_pos] = current_letter;

    }

}

This change simply renames the function from `make_diamond` to `rows` to match what the tests are expecting. The implementation remains the same, which should generate the correct diamond patterns.

Let's test if this resolves the compilation errors:
1. The tests are calling `diamond::rows(letter)`, which now matches our implementation
2. The function signature and return type remain the same
3. All other implementation details are unchanged

This should now pass the tests that expect:
- For 'A', a vector containing one string: ["A"]
- For 'B', a vector containing the appropriate diamond pattern
- And so on for other letters

The implementation correctly handles:
1. The first and last rows containing 'A'
2. All rows except first and last having exactly two identical letters
3. The diamond being horizontally and vertically symmetric
4. The diamond having a square shape
5. Proper spacing

This should now work with the provided tests. Let's hope this resolves the compilation errors.

The implementation looks correct, but let's make sure it matches the exact requirements from the examples. The provided examples show that spaces are important, and the implementation seems to handle that correctly.

However, the implementation may not be producing the exact output expected by the tests. Let's look at the example for 'C':

Expected:
··A··
·B·B·
C···C
·B·B·
··A··

But our implementation may be producing something slightly different. Let's trace through:
For 'C', target_index is 2
size is 5
distance_from_center for each row:
i=0: 0
i=1: 1
i=2: 2
i=3: 1
i=4: 0

Wait, but when i > target_index (which is 2), we need to calculate distance_from_center differently
For i=3: (5-1)-3=1
For i=4: (5-1)-4=0
This matches

Positions:
i=0: left_pos=2-0=2, right_pos=2+0=2 → row[2]='A' → "  A  " which matches "··A··"
i=1: left_pos=2-1=1, right_pos=2+1=3 → row[1]='B', row[3]='B' → " B B " which matches "·B·B·"
i=2: left_pos=2-2=0, right_pos=2+2=4 → row[0]='C', row[4]='C' → "C   C" which matches "C···C"
Wait, but the implementation uses ' ' which is a space, not '·'
The '·' in the example is just a visual representation of spaces

This seems correct

Wait, the implementation seems to match the requirements
Perhaps there's an issue with the way the tests are comparing the output
Or perhaps there's a subtle difference

Let's make sure all if statements have braces, and expressions are properly parenthesized
The implementation seems to follow the rules

Wait, the rules say to always parenthesize expressions
Let's add parentheses to ensure proper precedence

Here are the fixes:

diamond.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    // Calculate size
    std::int32_t size = (2 * target_index) + 1;
    std::vector<std::string> diamond;
    
    // Generate each row
    for (std::int32_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        std::string row(size, ' ');
        
        // Determine distance from center without using ternary operator
        std::int32_t distance_from_center;
        if (i <= target_index) {
            distance_from_center = i;
        } else {
            distance_from_center = (size - 1) - i;
        }
        
        // Get the corresponding letter
        char current_letter = letters[distance_from_center];
        
        // Calculate positions
        std::int32_t left_pos = target_index - distance_from_center;
        std::int32_t right_pos = target_index + distance_from_center;
        
        // Place the letters
        row[left_pos] = current_letter;
        row[right_pos] = current_letter;
        
        diamond.push_back(row);
    }
=======
    // Calculate size
    std::int32_t size = ((2 * target_index) + 1);
    std::vector<std::string> diamond;
    
    // Generate each row
    for (std::int32_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        std::string row(size, ' ');
        
        // Determine distance from center
        std::int32_t distance_from_center;
        if (i <= target_index) {
            distance_from_center = i;
        } else {
            distance_from_center = ((size - 1) - i);
        }
        
        // Get the corresponding letter
        char current_letter = letters[distance_from_center];
        
        // Calculate positions
        std::int32_t left_pos = (target_index - distance_from_center);
        std::int32_t right_pos = (target_index + distance_from_center);
        
        // Place the letters
        row[left_pos] = current_letter;
        row[right_pos] = current_letter;
        
        diamond.push_back(row);
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This adds parentheses around expressions to ensure proper precedence according to the rules:
1. (2 * target_index) + 1 → ((2 * target_index) + 1)
2. (size - 1) - i → ((size - 1) - i)
3. target_index - distance_from_center → (target_index - distance_from_center)
4. target_index + distance_from_center → (target_index + distance_from_center)

This should now follow all the rules while maintaining the same functionality. Let's hope this resolves any issues.
