#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a fancy store.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value and weight.  
#### Bob would gladly take all of the items, but his knapsack can only hold so much weight.  
#### Bob has to carefully consider which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to determine which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized, taking into account the knapsack's carrying capacity.  
####   
#### Items will be represented as a list of items.  
#### Each item will have a weight and value.  
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10  
#### ```  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.h knapsack.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I understand. We need to implement a function that solves the classic 0/1 knapsack problem, where we can either take an item or leave it, and we want to maximize the total value without exceeding the maximum weight capacity.

Since all values are positive, and weights can be up to the maximum capacity, we can use dynamic programming to solve this efficiently.

However, the implementation needs to be in the provided files. Let's add a function to the knapsack namespace that takes a list of items and maximum weight, and returns the maximum value.

Since the implementation needs to be in the knapsack.cpp file, we'll need to declare the function in knapsack.h first.

Wait, the maximum weight can be up to 1000 or more? Let's think about the implementation.
Since the number of items can be up to 1000, and maximum weight up to 1000, O(n*W) complexity should be fine (1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000 operations).

Let's implement this:

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Add the function declaration to knapsack.h
2. Implement the function in knapsack.cpp

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

knapsack.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    int weight;
    int value;
};

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
=======
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

#include <vector>

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    int weight;
    int value;
};

int maximumValue(int maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items);

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the maximumValue function in knapsack.cpp using dynamic programming:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"

namespace knapsack
{

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

namespace knapsack
{

int maximumValue(int maximumWeight, const vector<Item>& items) {
    if (items.empty()) return 0;
    
    int n = items.size();
    // DP table where dp[i][w] represents the maximum value that can be obtained
    // using the first i items with weight limit w
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(maximumWeight + 1, 0));
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int w = 0; w <= maximumWeight; w++) {
            // If current item's weight is more than the current capacity, we can't include it
            if (items[i-1].weight > w) {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
            } else {
                // We have two choices: include the item or not
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], 
                               dp[i-1][w - items[i-1].weight] + items[i-1].value);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][maximumWeight];
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, this implementation uses O(n*W) space which is fine for the constraints. But to optimize space, we can use a 1D array:
But since the problem doesn't specify constraints, and to keep it simple, we'll use the 2D approach.

Wait, the maximum weight can be up to 1000, and number of items up to 1000, which would be 1,000,000 integers which is 4MB which should be fine.

This implementation should work for the provided example:
Items: 
{5,10}, {4,40}, {6,30}, {4,50}
Maximum weight: 10

Let's trace through:
For i=2 (second item), weight=4, value=40
At w=4: max(0 + 40, dp[1][4]=0) -> 40
...
At w=9: max(dp[1][9-4=5] + 40, dp[1][9])
But we need to fill the table properly.

Wait, the implementation should be correct. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation looks correct, but there might be some issues with the function signature. Let's check if the implementation matches the declaration. The function declaration in knapsack.h uses `std::vector<Item>`, which matches the implementation.

However, to ensure everything is consistent, let's include the vector header in knapsack.cpp and use std:: explicitly to avoid any potential issues.

Wait, the implementation already includes <vector> and uses using namespace std; which is generally not recommended in header files, but since it's in the implementation file, it's okay.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Let's run through the provided example:
Items: weight 5, value 10; weight 4, value 40; weight 6, value 30; weight 4, value 50
Maximum weight: 10

The implementation should select items 2 and 4:
Value: 40 + 50 = 90
Weight: 4 + 4 = 8 ≤ 10

This matches the example.

However, to make sure it's robust, let's handle cases where maximumWeight is 0 or items are empty.
The implementation already handles empty items by returning 0.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Let's see if there are any issues:
1. We need to make sure all includes are present
2. We need to make sure we're using the right types

Actually, the implementation looks good. Let's make sure we're always using std:: to be explicit and avoid any potential issues with namespaces.

Wait, the implementation uses 'using namespace std;' which is not best practice. Let's remove that and use std:: explicitly.

Here are the necessary fixes:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

namespace knapsack
{

int maximumValue(int maximumWeight, const vector<Item>& items) {
    if (items.empty()) return 0;
    
    int n = items.size();
    // DP table where dp[i][w] represents the maximum value that can be obtained
    // using the first i items with weight limit w
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(maximumWeight + 1, 0));
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int w = 0; w <= maximumWeight; w++) {
            // If current item's weight is more than the current capacity, we can't include it
            if (items[i-1].weight > w) {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
            } else {
                // We have two choices: include the item or not
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], 
                               dp[i-1][w - items[i-1].weight] + items[i-1].value);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][maximumWeight];
}

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

namespace knapsack
{

int maximumValue(int maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items) {
    if (items.empty() || maximumWeight == 0) return 0;
    
    int n = items.size();
    // Create a DP table
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n + 1, std::vector<int>(maximumWeight + 1, 0));
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int w = 0; w <= maximumWeight; w++) {
            // If the current item's weight is more than the current capacity, skip it
            if (items[i-1].weight > w) {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
            } else {
                // Otherwise, take the maximum between including and not including the item
                dp[i][w] = std::max(dp[i-1][w], 
                                   dp[i-1][w - items[i-1].weight] + items[i-1].value);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][maximumWeight];
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should now be more explicit and follow best practices by not using 'using namespace std;'. It also handles the case where maximumWeight is 0.

However, to optimize space, we could use a 1D array, but since the constraints aren't specified to be very large, the 2D approach is fine for clarity.

This implementation should work correctly for all cases:
- When there are no items
- When maximum weight is 0
- When items have weights that exceed the maximum weight
- Normal cases

Let's test our implementation with the provided example:
Items: 
{5,10}, {4,40}, {6,30}, {4,50}
Maximum weight: 10

The implementation should return 90, which matches the expected result.

I understand. The tests are calling a function named `maximum_value`, but our implementation uses `maximumValue`. We need to rename our function to match what the tests expect.

Let's fix that:

Here are the necessary changes:

knapsack.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
int maximumValue(int maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items);
=======
int maximum_value(int maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
int maximumValue(int maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items) {
    if (items.empty() || maximumWeight == 0) return 0;
    
    int n = items.size();
    // Create a DP table
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n + 1, std::vector<int>(maximumWeight + 1, 0));
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int w = 0; w <= maximumWeight; w++) {
            // If the current item's weight is more than the current capacity, skip it
            if (items[i-1].weight > w) {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
            } else {
                // Otherwise, take the maximum between including and not including the item
                dp[i][w] = std::max(dp[i-1][w], 
                                   dp[i-1][w - items[i-1].weight] + items[i-1].value);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][maximumWeight];
}
=======
int maximum_value(int maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items) {
    if (items.empty() || maximumWeight == 0) return 0;
    
    int n = items.size();
    // Create a DP table
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n + 1, std::vector<int>(maximumWeight + 1, 0));
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int w = 0; w <= maximumWeight; w++) {
            // If the current item's weight is more than the current capacity, skip it
            if (items[i-1].weight > w) {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
            } else {
                // Otherwise, take the maximum between including and not including the item
                dp[i][w] = std::max(dp[i-1][w], 
                                   dp[i-1][w - items[i-1].weight] + items[i-1].value);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][maximumWeight];
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change simply renames the function from `maximumValue` to `maximum_value` to match what the tests are expecting. The implementation remains the same, which should correctly solve the knapsack problem using dynamic programming.

This should now pass all the test cases:
1. When there are no items
2. When maximum weight is 0
3. When items have weights that can be selected to maximize value
4. Various other scenarios

Let's hope this resolves the compilation errors. The implementation itself is correct for solving the 0/1 knapsack problem, which is what's needed here.

I see. The implementation looks correct, but there might be an issue with handling cases where the maximum weight is 0. Let's test our implementation:

Wait, the implementation returns 0 if maximumWeight == 0, which is correct because you can't carry any items.
But the tests might be expecting something else? Or perhaps there's another issue.

Actually, the implementation seems correct. Let's run through the provided example:
Items: weight 5, value 10; weight 4, value 40; weight 6, value 30; weight 4, value 50
Maximum weight: 10

The implementation should select items 2 and 4:
Value: 40 + 50 = 90
Weight: 4 + 4 = 8 ≤ 10

This matches the example.

Wait, the implementation uses a 2D DP approach which is correct for 0/1 knapsack.
But to optimize, we can use a 1D array to save space.

However, since the implementation seems correct, perhaps there's an issue with integer sizes or something else.
Let's make sure all weights and values are non-negative, which they are according to the instructions.

Wait, the implementation might be accessing out of bounds if an item's weight is greater than maximumWeight.
But we have a check: if (items[i-1].weight > w) which prevents that.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Let's make sure we're always using the right indices.
Wait, when w - items[i-1].weight could be negative, but our condition ensures it's always non-negative.

Perhaps the issue is with very large numbers? But the implementation uses int which should be fine.

Wait, the implementation might be too slow? But with 1000 items and 1000 weight, 1,000,000 operations is fine.

Actually, let's try to optimize the implementation to use a 1D array to see if that helps:

Wait, the implementation is correct. Let's try to run it with the provided example:
But since we can't run it, we need to trust our implementation.

Wait, the implementation might have an off-by-one error.
Let's print the implementation step by step:
But since we can't, let's trust our implementation.

Actually, let's use a 1D array approach which is more efficient:

Here's the optimized implementation:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

namespace knapsack
{

int maximum_value(int maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items) {
    if (items.empty() || maximumWeight == 0) return 0;
    
    int n = items.size();
    // Create a DP table
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n + 1, std::vector<int>(maximumWeight + 1, 0));
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int w = 0; w <= maximumWeight; w++) {
            // If the current item's weight is more than the current capacity, skip it
            if (items[i-1].weight > w) {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
            } else {
                // Otherwise, take the maximum between including and not including the item
                dp[i][w] = std::max(dp[i-1][w], 
                                   dp[i-1][w - items[i-1].weight] + items[i-1].value);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][maximumWeight];
}

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

namespace knapsack
{

int maximum_value(int maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items) {
    std::vector<int> dp(maximumWeight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items) {
        // Process weights in reverse to avoid reusing the same item
        for (int w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; w--) {
            dp[w] = std::max(dp[w], dp[w - item.weight] + item.value);
        }
    }
    
    return dp[maximumWeight];
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation uses a 1D array which is more efficient in terms of space and should work the same way.
It processes the weights in reverse to ensure each item is only used once, which is correct for the 0/1 knapsack problem.

This should handle all cases correctly:
- When there are no items: the loop won't run, and dp[maximumWeight] remains 0
- When maximum weight is 0: the outer loop may run, but the inner loop condition w >= item.weight will always be false if item.weight > 0
- Normal cases where items are selected to maximize value

This implementation should now pass all the test cases. Let's hope this resolves any issues.
