#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a fancy store.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value and weight.  
#### Bob would gladly take all of the items, but his knapsack can only hold so much weight.  
#### Bob has to carefully consider which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to determine which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized, taking into account the knapsack's carrying capacity.  
####   
#### Items will be represented as a list of items.  
#### Each item will have a weight and value.  
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10  
#### ```  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.h knapsack.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a solution to the classic 0/1 knapsack problem. Since the weights can be up to a certain maximum, and we need to find the maximum value, we can use dynamic programming.

However, the implementation needs to be efficient. Since the maximum weight can be up to a certain value, and the number of items can be large, we need to be careful about the approach.

Since all values are positive, and we want to maximize the total value, we can use a dynamic programming approach where dp[i] represents the maximum value achievable with weight i.

However, the problem statement doesn't specify constraints, so we need to be general. Let's implement a standard dynamic programming approach.

Wait, the function signature isn't provided. Let's add a function to the namespace that takes a vector of items and maximum weight, and returns the maximum value.

Since we need to modify the files, let's add the necessary includes and function declarations.

Here are the necessary changes:

First, let's update the header file to include the function declaration:

knapsack.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    int weight;
    int value;
};

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
=======
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    std::int32_t weight;
    std::int32_t value;
};

std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items);

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the function in the cpp file:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"

namespace knapsack
{

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty() || (maximumWeight == 0))
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i] is the maximum value with weight i
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximumWeight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process from the end
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in dp array
    // Since dp[i] is always non-decreasing, the last element is the maximum
    return dp[maximumWeight];
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation uses dynamic programming where dp[w] stores the maximum value that can be achieved with weight w. We process each item and update the dp array from the maximum weight down to the item's weight to ensure each item is only used once.

However, there are a few things to note:
1. All values are positive, so initializing dp with 0 is correct
2. We need to process weights in reverse to avoid reusing items
3. The maximum value will be at dp[maximumWeight]

This implementation should work within the constraints and follows the instructions:
- Uses standard integer types from <cstdint>
- All variables are appropriately typed
- The implementation is efficient with O(n * W) time complexity where n is number of items and W is maximum weight
- It only uses standard libraries

However, if maximumWeight is very large, this approach may be too slow, but without knowing constraints, this is a standard approach. If there are performance issues, we may need to use a different approach, but for now, this should work.

I understand. The implementation looks correct, but let's make sure it handles all cases properly. The implementation uses dynamic programming which is standard for the 0/1 knapsack problem.

However, there's a potential issue: if maximumWeight is very large, this approach may use a lot of memory, but without knowing constraints, this is fine. Also, all values are positive, which is good.

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but let's test it with the provided example:
Items: weight-value pairs: (5,10), (4,40), (6,30), (4,50)
Maximum weight: 10

Processing:
Initialize dp[0..10] = 0
Process item 1 (5,10): 
   w=10: max(0, dp[5]+10=10) -> 10
   w=9: max(0, dp[4]+10=10) -> 10
   etc.
Process item 2 (4,40):
   w=10: max(10, dp[6]+40=40) -> 40
   w=9: max(10, dp[5]+40=50) -> 50
   etc.
Process item 3 (6,30):
   w=10: max(40, dp[4]+30=40) -> 40
   w=9: max(50, dp[3]+30=30) -> 50
   etc.
Process item 4 (4,50):
   w=10: max(40, dp[6]+50=90) -> 90
   w=9: max(50, dp[5]+50=60) -> 60
   etc.
Result: dp[10] = 90 which matches the example.

This seems correct. Let's make sure the implementation follows the rules:
1. Use fixed-width integer types: Yes, using std::int32_t
2. No mixing of types: All operations are between std::int32_t
3. Parentheses are used appropriately

Wait, there's one line that might need parentheses:
if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
This is fine, but to be precise, let's add more parentheses to ensure operator precedence is clear.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the user wants to see the implementation with better formatting or something else?

Actually, the implementation is correct, but perhaps the issue is that the maximum value might not always be at dp[maximumWeight]? No, because we're always taking non-negative values, and weights are non-negative, so dp is non-decreasing.

Wait, the implementation always returns dp[maximumWeight], which is correct.

Since the implementation seems correct, and the user says to fix errors, perhaps there are compilation issues? Let's make sure all includes are present.

Wait, the implementation includes <vector> and <algorithm> which are necessary. But in the header, we need to include <cstdint> which is already there.

Perhaps the implementation needs to be more efficient? Or perhaps there are test cases where maximumWeight is 0 or items are empty, which we handle.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Let's make sure to add necessary includes and follow best practices.

Wait, the implementation in knapsack.cpp already includes "knapsack.h", <vector>, <algorithm>, and <cstdint>. This seems sufficient.

Perhaps the user wants to see the implementation with better variable names or comments.

Since the implementation seems correct, I'll just make sure it's properly formatted and follows the rules:

Here's a slight reorganization to ensure all operations are properly parenthesized:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty() || (maximumWeight == 0))
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i] is the maximum value with weight i
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximumWeight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process from the end
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in dp array
    // Since dp[i] is always non-decreasing, the last element is the maximum
    return dp[maximumWeight];
}

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if ((items.empty()) || (maximumWeight == 0))
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximumWeight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[maximumWeight];
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Uses proper parentheses around conditions
2. Ensures all operations are clear
3. Follows the same logic which is correct for the 0/1 knapsack problem
4. Uses fixed-width integer types
5. Handles edge cases where items are empty or maximum weight is 0

This should now be ready to use. If there are specific test cases that are failing, we may need to see those to debug further, but based on the information provided, this implementation is correct.

I understand. The tests are expecting a function named `maximum_value`, but our implementation uses `maximumValue`. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

{
    if ((items.empty()) || (maximumWeight == 0))
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximumWeight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[maximumWeight];
}

    }
    
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximumWeight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[maximumWeight];
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change simply renames the function from `maximumValue` to `maximum_value` to match what the tests expect. The implementation remains the same, which should correctly solve the 0/1 knapsack problem.

This should now compile and pass the tests, as the function name matches what the tests are looking for. The implementation uses dynamic programming to find the maximum value that can be obtained without exceeding the maximum weight, which is the standard approach for this problem.

I see. The implementation looks correct, but perhaps there are issues with integer types or other constraints. Let's make sure all integer types are consistent and follow the rules provided.

Since the weights and values are always positive, and the maximum weight can be up to a certain value, we need to ensure:
1. All types are appropriate fixed-width types
2. No implicit conversions that could cause issues
3. All operations are properly parenthesized

Wait, the implementation uses std::int32_t which matches the declaration, which is good.
But perhaps the maximum weight could be large, and we need to make sure we don't have integer overflows.

However, the implementation seems correct. Let's make sure all operations are properly parenthesized according to the rules:

Wait, the implementation already seems to follow the parentheses rules:
1. Conditions are properly parenthesized
2. Arithmetic operations are parenthesized

Perhaps the issue is that when maximumWeight is large, the implementation may be too slow, but without knowing constraints, this is the standard approach.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Let's make sure to include all necessary headers and follow best practices.

Wait, the implementation includes <algorithm> which may not be necessary, but it's not harmful.

Since the implementation seems correct, and the user says to fix errors, perhaps there are test cases where the implementation fails.
Let's make sure to handle cases where item weights could be larger than the current weight being considered in the loop.

Wait, the loop condition is `w >= item.weight`, which ensures we don't access negative indices, which is correct.

Perhaps the implementation needs to use uint32_t instead of int32_t? But the function signature uses int32_t, so we should stick to that.

Actually, the implementation seems correct. Let's make sure to add some additional checks to prevent potential issues:

Wait, to be extra careful, let's add a check to ensure item.weight is non-negative, though the problem says all values are positive, which implies weights are positive too.

Here's a slightly modified implementation:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if ((items.empty()) || (maximumWeight == 0))
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximumWeight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[maximumWeight];
}

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    // Handle edge cases
    if ((maximumWeight <= 0) || (items.empty()))
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array to store maximum values for each weight
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(static_cast<std::size_t>(maximumWeight) + 1, 0);
    
    // Process each item
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // Ensure the item's weight is valid
        if (item.weight < 0)
        {
            continue;
        }
        
        // Update the DP array from the end to avoid reusing items
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            std::int32_t remaining_weight = (w - item.weight);
            std::int32_t new_value = (dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(remaining_weight)] + item.value);
            if (dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)] < new_value)
            {
                dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)] = new_value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(maximumWeight)];
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Adds explicit checks for item weight validity
2. Uses static_cast to ensure proper indexing (though it's not strictly necessary)
3. Breaks down operations into steps to ensure clarity
4. Follows parentheses rules by ensuring all operations are properly grouped
5. Uses the same fixed-width integer types throughout

However, this may be more verbose than necessary. Let's hope this addresses any potential issues.

Note: The problem states that all values are strictly positive, which implies weights are also positive, so the check for negative item.weight may be redundant, but it's better to be safe.

This implementation should now be robust and follow all the provided rules while solving the 0/1 knapsack problem correctly.
