#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.  
####   
#### `a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.  
#### The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.  
#### The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.  
####   
#### The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:  
#### `(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,  
#### `(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.  
####   
#### Multiplication result is by definition  
#### `(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.  
####   
#### The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is  
#### `1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:  
#### `(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Raising e to a complex exponent can be expressed as `e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`, the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,  
#### - conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.  
####   
#### Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: complex_numbers.cpp complex_numbers.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I'll implement a complex number class with the required operations. Let's start by defining the class structure in the header file and then implement the methods in the source file.

Since we need to use floating point numbers, we'll use `double` for the real and imaginary parts. Let's proceed:

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    
    // Operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Other functions
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement all the methods in the source file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "complex_numbers.h"

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
#include "complex_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

Complex::Complex(double real, double imag) : real_(real), imag_(imag) {}

double Complex::real() const {
    return real_;
}

double Complex::imag() const {
    return imag_;
}

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_ + other.real_, imag_ + other.imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_ - other.real_, imag_ - other.imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}

Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_, -imag_);
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex(magnitude * std::cos(imag_), magnitude * std::sin(imag_));
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation follows the mathematical operations described:
1. Addition and subtraction are straightforward
2. Multiplication uses the formula (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (bc + ad)i
3. Division uses the reciprocal approach
4. Absolute value uses the square root of the sum of squares
5. Conjugate flips the sign of the imaginary part
6. Exponential uses Euler's formula

However, I need to ensure that all operations are precise and handle edge cases appropriately. Since the instructions don't specify any special handling, we'll proceed with this implementation.

I understand. The implementation needs to match the interface that's expected by the tests. Since the tests may be using different function names, we need to ensure our implementation matches. Let's fix that.

However, the provided interface seems to be using member functions, which is correct. But perhaps the tests expect free functions or different names. Since the instructions say not to change existing function names, we need to make sure our implementation matches what the tests expect.

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but perhaps the tests expect the functions to be implemented differently. Let's make sure all operations are implemented as member functions.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. But perhaps there are some precision issues or edge cases to handle. Let's ensure division by zero is handled, but since the instructions don't specify, and C++ will produce NaN or inf which is probably fine.

Wait, the implementation uses `double` which should be fine, but the MISRA rules say to avoid standard types. However, the instructions say to use standard libraries, and `double` is a standard floating point type which is appropriate here.

Since the user provided the files, and they're using `double`, we'll continue to use `double`.

Let's make sure all operations are precise and follow the mathematical definitions correctly.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Let's run through each operation:
1. Addition: real + real, imag + imag
2. Subtraction: real - real, imag - imag
3. Multiplication: (a*c - b*d) + (b*c + a*d)i
4. Division: ((a*c + b*d)/(c² + d²)) + ((b*c - a*d)/(c² + d²))i
5. Absolute value: sqrt(a² + b²)
6. Conjugate: a - bi
7. Exponential: e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))

All seem correct. Perhaps there's an issue with the implementation of exp(). Let's make sure it's correct:
e^(a + bi) = e^a * e^(bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))

This matches our implementation.

Since the user sees errors, perhaps the tests expect different function signatures or names. But the instructions say not to change existing function names, so our implementation should be correct.

Wait, the implementation is using member functions, which matches the interface in the header. Perhaps the tests are using the functions differently.

Let's make sure all parentheses are added according to MISRA rules:
1. Always parenthesize binary operations when they're part of larger expressions
2. Ensure proper precedence

Wait, the implementation may need to add more parentheses to comply with MISRA rules. Let's fix that:

Here are the necessary fixes:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}
=======
Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Wait, these are the same. Let's add parentheses to ensure compliance with MISRA rules:

Wait, according to MISRA, we need to parenthesize expressions to make precedence clear. Let's add more parentheses where necessary:

Wait, all the expressions seem to have proper parentheses. Let's look at the division operation more carefully:
The numerator calculations are already parenthesized, which is good.

Perhaps the issue is that the tests expect different function names. But the instructions say not to change them.

Wait, maybe the tests are using the functions in a different way. Let's make sure all functions are implemented exactly as declared.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Perhaps the errors are from something else.

Since the user provided the exact files, and I can't see the actual errors, I need to trust that the implementation is correct. Let's proceed.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the implementation needs to be in a specific way that matches the tests. Since I can't see the tests, I need to ensure the implementation follows the mathematical definitions precisely.

Let's reimplement with extra care to precision and edge cases:

Wait, for division, if the denominator is zero, it will produce inf or nan, which is probably what's expected.
For exp(), it should handle large numbers correctly.

Since I can't see the actual errors, I'll provide a clean implementation that follows all the rules:

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Let's resubmit it as is.

I understand. The tests are trying to perform operations between complex numbers and real numbers (doubles), but our implementation only supports operations between complex numbers. We need to add overloads to handle these cases.

Since we can't change the test names, we need to add non-member operator overloads to handle cases where a double is on either side of the operator. Let's implement these.

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    // Operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
=======
    // Operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Friend functions for operations with doubles
    friend Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these friend functions in the source file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
// Friend function implementations
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real_ + rhs, lhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs + rhs.real_, rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real_ - rhs, lhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs - rhs.real_, -rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real_ * rhs, lhs.imag_ * rhs);
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs * rhs.real_, lhs * rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real_ / rhs, lhs.imag_ / rhs);
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To divide a real number by a complex number, we can treat the real number as a complex number
    // and use the complex division formula
    // (a + 0i) / (c + di) = (a*c)/(c² + d²) + (-a*d)/(c² + d²)i
    double denominator = (rhs.real_ * rhs.real_) + (rhs.imag_ * rhs.imag_);
    double real_part = (lhs * rhs.real_) / denominator;
    double imag_part = (-lhs * rhs.imag_) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These implementations will now handle cases where doubles are used with complex numbers in arithmetic operations:
1. Adding a double to a complex number treats the double as a complex number with zero imaginary part
2. Subtracting follows the same principle
3. Multiplication scales both real and imaginary parts by the double
4. Division either scales both parts (complex / double) or uses the complex division formula (double / complex)

This should now pass all the test cases that were failing due to type mismatches. Let's hope this resolves the issues.

I see the issue. The friend function declarations are inside the class, but they need to be defined outside the class as well. However, the implementations are already in the .cpp file. The problem might be that the friend functions need to be declared in the namespace scope, not just as friends within the class.

Let's move the friend function declarations outside the class but within the namespace:

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    // Friend functions for operations with doubles
    friend Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, add these declarations outside the class but within the namespace:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    // Other functions
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
};
=======
    // Other functions
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
};

// Non-member operator overloads
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This should now properly declare these operators in the namespace scope, which will allow them to be found by the compiler when performing operations between Complex numbers and doubles.

However, since these are now non-member functions, they'll need access to the private members of the Complex class. So we need to declare them as friends inside the class as well. Let's add that back:

Wait, to access private members, they either need to be friends or use public interface. Since real() and imag() are public, we can use those.

Wait, the implementations in the .cpp file use the private members directly. So we need to keep them as friends. Let's add the friend declarations back:

Wait, this is tricky. Let's make sure the friend declarations match the namespace-scope declarations.

Wait, the best approach is to declare them as friends inside the class, and also declare them in the namespace. But the friend declarations inside the class also act as declarations in the enclosing namespace.

Actually, the friend declarations inside the class should be sufficient. The errors may be due to something else.

Wait, the implementations are in the .cpp file, which is fine. Let's revert to the original approach and just add the friend declarations inside the class:

Wait, the initial implementation had friend declarations, and the implementations are in the .cpp file. This should work. Perhaps the issue is that the implementations need to be in the header file or declared inline.

But since we can't put them in the header (the user may not want that), let's explicitly declare them in the header outside the class:

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to declare them outside the class and implement them using the public interface:

Here's a revised approach:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    // Friend functions for operations with doubles
    friend Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    // Other functions
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
};
=======
    // Other functions
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
};

// Non-member operator overloads using public interface
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);

Now, let's update the implementations in the .cpp file to use the public interface:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Friend function implementations
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real_ + rhs, lhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs + rhs.real_, rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real_ - rhs, lhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs - rhs.real_, -rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real_ * rhs, lhs.imag_ * rhs);
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs * rhs.real_, lhs * rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real_ / rhs, lhs.imag_ / rhs);
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To divide a real number by a complex number, we can treat the real number as a complex number
    // and use the complex division formula
    // (a + 0i) / (c + di) = (a*c)/(c² + d²) + (-a*d)/(c² + d²)i
    double denominator = (rhs.real_ * rhs.real_) + (rhs.imag_ * rhs.imag_);
    double real_part = (lhs * rhs.real_) / denominator;
    double imag_part = (-lhs * rhs.imag_) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
=======
// Non-member operator implementations using public interface
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real() + rhs, lhs.imag());
}

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs + rhs.real(), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real() - rhs, lhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs - rhs.real(), -rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real() * rhs, lhs.imag() * rhs);
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs * rhs.real(), lhs * rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real() / rhs, lhs.imag() / rhs);
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // Use the complex division formula
    double denominator = (rhs.real() * rhs.real()) + (rhs.imag() * rhs.imag());
    double real_part = (lhs * rhs.real()) / denominator;
    double imag_part = (-lhs * rhs.imag()) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This should now work because we're using the public interface to access the real and imaginary parts, and the operators are properly declared in the namespace.

I understand. The issue is that there are duplicate declarations in the header file. Let's clean that up:

Here's the fix:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Non-member operator overloads using public interface
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);

// Non-member operator overloads
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
=======
// Non-member operator overloads
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This removes the duplicate declarations, keeping only one set of operator overloads. The implementations in the .cpp file should now match these declarations.

I see. The implementation looks correct, but there might be some issues with the order of declarations or includes. Let's make sure everything is properly structured.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Perhaps the issue is that the non-member operators need to be declared before they're used, but they're after the class declaration which is fine.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Let's make sure all the necessary includes are present and that there are no syntax errors.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Perhaps the issue is that the tests are not seeing the implementations. Let's make sure all the function signatures match.

Since the implementation looks correct, and the user provided the exact files, I'll assume they're correct and no changes are needed.

However, if there are still issues, they might be due to:
1. Missing includes
2. Implementation not matching declarations
3. Precision issues in floating point comparisons

But since the user hasn't provided specific error messages, I'll assume the implementation is correct as is.

If you're encountering specific errors, please share them so I can help fix them.
