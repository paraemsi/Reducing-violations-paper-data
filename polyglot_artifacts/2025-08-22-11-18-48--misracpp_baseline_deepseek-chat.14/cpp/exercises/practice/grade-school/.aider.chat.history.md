#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.  
####   
#### In the end, you should be able to:  
####   
#### - Add a student's name to the roster for a grade  
####   - "Add Jim to grade 2."  
####   - "OK."  
#### - Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade  
####   - "Which students are in grade 2?"  
####   - "We've only got Jim just now."  
#### - Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  
####   Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.  
####   - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"  
####   - "Let me think.  
####     We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.  
####     So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"  
####   
#### Note that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.  
#### In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grade_school.cpp grade_school.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I understand. We need to implement a school roster system that can add students to grades and retrieve them in a sorted manner. Let's think through this:

1. We need a data structure to store students per grade
2. Each grade should have a list of student names
3. The names within each grade should be kept sorted
4. When retrieving all students, grades should be ordered numerically, and names alphabetically per grade
5. We need to ensure no duplicate students are added to the same grade

Since this is C++, we can use a map from grade numbers to lists of names, and always keep the lists sorted.
However, to prevent duplicates, we need to check if a student is already in a grade before adding.

Wait, the instructions say "each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster", which might mean:
1. A student can't be in the same grade multiple times
2. Or a student can't be in multiple grades at all
But the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let's assume it's the first interpretation, which is more straightforward.

Now, let's implement this:

First, we need to add the necessary includes and define the class interface.
Since the namespace is empty, we need to add a class or functions within the namespace.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a map to store the roster
2. Add a function to add a student to a grade
3. Add a function to get students for a specific grade
4. Add a function to get all students across all grades, sorted appropriately

Here are the necessary changes:

grade_school.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(GRADE_SCHOOL_H)
#define GRADE_SCHOOL_H

namespace grade_school {

}  // namespace grade_school

#endif // GRADE_SCHOOL_H
=======
#if !defined(GRADE_SCHOOL_H)
#define GRADE_SCHOOL_H

#include <map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

namespace grade_school {

class school {
private:
    std::map<int, std::vector<std::string>> roster_;
public:
    school();
    std::map<int, std::vector<std::string>> roster() const;
    void add(const std::string& name, int grade);
    std::vector<std::string> grade(int grade) const;
};

}  // namespace grade_school

#endif // GRADE_SCHOOL_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation in grade_school.cpp:

grade_school.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "grade_school.h"

namespace grade_school {

}  // namespace grade_school
=======
#include "grade_school.h"
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdexcept>
using namespace std;

namespace grade_school {

school::school() {
    // Initialize an empty roster
}

map<int, vector<string>> school::roster() const {
    // Return a copy of the roster
    return roster_;
}

void school::add(const string& name, int grade) {
    // Check if the student is already in the specified grade
    auto it = roster_.find(grade);
    if (it != roster_.end()) {
        // Check if the name already exists in the grade
        const auto& students = it->second;
        if (find(students.begin(), students.end(), name) != students.end()) {
            // Student already exists in this grade
            // According to the note, this should be treated as incorrect
            // We can throw an exception or just ignore, but the note says to indicate it's incorrect
            // Let's throw an exception
            throw invalid_argument("Student already exists in this grade");
        }
    }
    
    // Add the student to the grade and keep the list sorted
    roster_[grade].push_back(name);
    // Sort the list for this grade
    sort(roster_[grade].begin(), roster_[grade].end());
}

vector<string> school::grade(int grade) const {
    // Return students for the requested grade, or an empty vector if the grade doesn't exist
    auto it = roster_.find(grade);
    if (it != roster_.end()) {
        return it->second;
    }
    return {};
}

}  // namespace grade_school
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a note that says "each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster". This could be interpreted in two ways:
1. A student can't be in the same grade multiple times (which we handle)
2. A student can't be in the school multiple times across any grades

The implementation above handles the first interpretation. If the second interpretation is correct, we'd need to scan all grades to check if the student exists anywhere, which is more involved.

Since the instructions say "to a grade or the roster", it might mean the second interpretation. Let's adjust:

Wait, the note says "each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster", which could mean:
1. They can't be added to the same grade more than once
2. They can't be added to the school (any grade) more than once

But the word "or" makes it ambiguous. Let's assume the first interpretation for now, and if tests fail, we can adjust.

This implementation should work for the basic requirements:
- Add students to grades
- Get sorted lists per grade
- Get all students sorted by grade and within grade by name
- Prevent adding the same student to the same grade multiple times

However, the roster() function needs to return a map where the vectors are sorted, which they always are because we sort after every addition.

This implementation should be efficient enough for the expected usage patterns. Let's proceed.

I notice that the implementation may not match the expected interface from the tests. The instructions mention that we should be able to interact with the school in certain ways, but the implementation uses a class which might not be what the tests expect.

Wait, the provided files already have a class structure, so we need to work with that. However, the implementation needs to ensure that:
1. The roster() function returns all students sorted by grade and within grade by name
2. The grade() function returns students for a specific grade, sorted by name
3. The add() function adds students while maintaining these invariants

However, the implementation seems to sort after every addition, which is fine, but there's a potential issue with checking for duplicates across all grades vs within a single grade.

The note says: "each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster"
This likely means a student can't be in multiple grades, and also can't be in the same grade multiple times.
So we need to check if the student exists in any grade before adding.

Let's fix that:

Here are the necessary changes:

grade_school.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "grade_school.h"
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdexcept>
using namespace std;

namespace grade_school {

school::school() {
    // Initialize an empty roster
}

map<int, vector<string>> school::roster() const {
    // Return a copy of the roster
    return roster_;
}

void school::add(const string& name, int grade) {
    // Check if the student is already in the specified grade
    auto it = roster_.find(grade);
    if (it != roster_.end()) {
        // Check if the name already exists in the grade
        const auto& students = it->second;
        if (find(students.begin(), students.end(), name) != students.end()) {
            // Student already exists in this grade
            // According to the note, this should be treated as incorrect
            // We can throw an exception or just ignore, but the note says to indicate it's incorrect
            // Let's throw an exception
            throw invalid_argument("Student already exists in this grade");
        }
    }
    
    // Add the student to the grade and keep the list sorted
    roster_[grade].push_back(name);
    // Sort the list for this grade
    sort(roster_[grade].begin(), roster_[grade].end());
}

vector<string> school::grade(int grade) const {
    // Return students for the requested grade, or an empty vector if the grade doesn't exist
    auto it = roster_.find(grade);
    if (it != roster_.end()) {
        return it->second;
    }
    return {};
}

}  // namespace grade_school
=======
#include "grade_school.h"
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdexcept>
using namespace std;

namespace grade_school {

school::school() {
    // Initialize an empty roster
}

map<int, vector<string>> school::roster() const {
    // Return a copy of the roster where each grade's list is sorted
    // Since we always keep the lists sorted when adding, we can just return the roster_
    return roster_;
}

void school::add(const string& name, int grade) {
    // Check if the student exists in any grade
    for (const auto& entry : roster_) {
        const auto& students = entry.second;
        if (find(students.begin(), students.end(), name) != students.end()) {
            throw invalid_argument("Student already exists in the roster");
        }
    }
    
    // Add the student to the grade
    roster_[grade].push_back(name);
    // Sort the list for this grade
    sort(roster_[grade].begin(), roster_[grade].end());
}

vector<string> school::grade(int grade) const {
    // Return students for the requested grade, or an empty vector if the grade doesn't exist
    auto it = roster_.find(grade);
    if (it != roster_.end()) {
        // Return a copy of the vector which is always sorted
        return it->second;
    }
    return {};
}

}  // namespace grade_school
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, this implementation now checks if a student exists anywhere in the roster before adding them, which satisfies the condition that a student can't be added more than once to the roster.

This should now handle:
1. Adding students only if they're not already in any grade
2. Keeping each grade's list of students sorted alphabetically
3. The roster() method returns a map where grades are ordered numerically (which std::map does by default for int keys)
4. The grade() method returns a sorted list of students for the requested grade

This implementation should now meet all the requirements:
- "Add Jim to grade 2." -> add("Jim", 2)
- "Which students are in grade 2?" -> grade(2)
- "Who all is enrolled in school right now?" -> roster()

Let's hope this implementation passes any tests that may be run against it.
