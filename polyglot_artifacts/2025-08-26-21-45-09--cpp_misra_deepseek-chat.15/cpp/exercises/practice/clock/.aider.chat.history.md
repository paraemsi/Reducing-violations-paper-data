#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a clock that handles times without dates.  
####   
#### You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.  
####   
#### Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.cpp clock.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. Let's implement a clock that handles times without dates, allowing addition and subtraction of minutes, and ensuring that two clocks representing the same time are equal.

Since we need to represent time, we can store the total minutes since 00:00, and always normalize it to be within 0-1439 (since there are 1440 minutes in a day). This makes comparisons and operations straightforward.

However, we need to define a Clock class that can handle these operations. Let's implement it:

1. The Clock should have a way to represent hours and minutes
2. We need to be able to add and subtract minutes
3. We need to be able to compare two clocks for equality
4. We need to be able to get a string representation

Since the files are empty, we need to define everything from scratch.

Wait, the instructions say not to change the names of existing functions or classes, but the files are empty. So we need to implement everything.

Let's implement a Clock class within the date_independent namespace.

Here's the plan:
1. Store time as total minutes, always normalized to be between 0 and 1439
2. Implement constructors, plus, minus operators
3. Implement equality operators
4. Implement a toString() method to get the time as a string

Here are the necessary changes:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
=======
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

#include <string>
#include <cstdint>

namespace date_independent {
    class clock {
    private:
        std::int32_t minutes;
        explicit clock(std::int32_t total_minutes);
    public:
        static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
        clock plus(std::int32_t add_minutes) const;
        clock minus(std::int32_t sub_minutes) const;
        operator std::string() const;
        bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
        bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;
    };
}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in clock.cpp:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {
    clock::clock(std::int32_t total_minutes) {
        // Normalize to be within 0-1439
        total_minutes %= 1440;
        if (total_minutes < 0) {
            total_minutes += 1440;
        }
        this->minutes = total_minutes;
    }

    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        return clock(total_minutes);
    }

    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t add_minutes) const {
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (this->minutes + add_minutes) % 1440;
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }

    clock clock::minus(std::int32_t sub_minutes) const {
        return this->plus(-sub_minutes);
    }

    clock::operator std::string() const {
        std::int32_t hours = this->minutes / 60;
        std::int32_t mins = this->minutes % 60;
        
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
            << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
        return oss.str();
    }

    bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
        return this->minutes == other.minutes;
    }

    bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
        return !(*this == other);
    }
}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The plus and minus operations need to handle large numbers correctly
2. We always normalize the time to be within 0-1439 minutes
3. The implementation uses modulo arithmetic to handle wrapping around midnight
4. We use std::int32_t to ensure fixed-width types as per the rules
5. The implementation follows the rules about numeric types by always using the same types
6. We use parentheses where necessary to ensure operator precedence is clear

This implementation should handle:
- Creating clocks with at(hours, minutes)
- Adding and subtracting minutes
- Comparing clocks for equality
- Converting to a string in HH:MM format

However, the implementation of plus() and minus() needs to handle very large numbers correctly. Since we're using modulo 1440, it will always wrap around correctly, even for very large positive or negative values.

This implementation should meet all the requirements:
1. Handle times without dates
2. Add and subtract minutes
3. Two clocks representing the same time are equal
4. Follow the provided rules about integer types and operator precedence

Let me know if you have any questions or need further modifications!

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle the conversion from hours and minutes to total minutes correctly, especially when hours and minutes can be negative or very large. Let's fix that.

The issue is that when creating a clock using `at(hours, minutes)`, we need to handle cases where minutes could be negative or greater than 59, and hours could be negative. We need to always normalize to a valid time between 00:00 and 23:59.

Here are the necessary fixes:

1. The `at` function needs to convert hours and minutes to total minutes and then normalize
2. The normalization should always produce a value between 0 and 1439
3. We need to handle large values correctly

Here are the fixes:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        return clock(total_minutes);
    }
=======
    clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
        // Convert everything to total minutes and normalize
        std::int32_t total_minutes = (hours * 60) + minutes;
        // Normalize to be within 0-1439
        total_minutes %= 1440;
        if (total_minutes < 0) {
            total_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(total_minutes);
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's another potential issue: the implementation of `plus` and `minus` may not handle very large numbers correctly due to integer overflow. Let's fix that by always using modulo arithmetic:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t add_minutes) const {
        std::int32_t new_minutes = (this->minutes + add_minutes) % 1440;
        if (new_minutes < 0) {
            new_minutes += 1440;
        }
        return clock(new_minutes);
    }
=======
    clock clock::plus(std::int32_t add_minutes) const {
        // Handle large add_minutes by taking modulo 1440 to prevent overflow
        // First, convert to int64_t to prevent overflow during addition
        std::int64_t total = static_cast<std::int64_t>(this->minutes) + add_minutes;
        // Normalize to be within 0-1439
        total %= 1440;
        if (total < 0) {
            total += 1440;
        }
        return clock(static_cast<std::int32_t>(total));
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation uses a 64-bit integer to prevent overflow during addition, which is important when adding very large numbers of minutes. Then it normalizes the result to be within the valid range.

The `minus` function uses `plus(-sub_minutes)`, which should work correctly with our new implementation of `plus`.

Also, the `operator std::string() const` implementation needs to ensure that hours are always between 0 and 23. Since minutes are always normalized, this should be the case, but let's make sure:

Wait, when we divide minutes by 60, we always get a value between 0 and 23, which is correct.
But to be safe, we can use modulo 24 for hours, but it's not necessary because minutes is always between 0 and 1439.

However, the implementation is correct:
- minutes / 60 will always be between 0 and 23
- minutes % 60 will always be between 0 and 59

This implementation should now handle all cases correctly, including:
- Large values for hours and minutes in at()
- Large values for add_minutes in plus()
- Negative values
- Comparisons

Let's also make sure to include the necessary headers:

Wait, we already have:
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

Which should be sufficient.

This implementation should now be robust and follow all the provided rules. Let me know if there are any further issues!
