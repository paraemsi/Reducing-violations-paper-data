#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of [perfect](#perfect), [abundant](#abundant), or [deficient](#deficient) based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The _aliquot sum_ is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of `15` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.  
####   
#### ## Perfect  
####   
#### A number is perfect when it equals its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `6` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`  
#### - `28` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`  
####   
#### ## Abundant  
####   
#### A number is abundant when it is less than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `12` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
#### - `24` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36`  
####   
#### ## Deficient  
####   
#### A number is deficient when it is greater than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `8` is a deficient number because `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`  
#### - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is [perfect](#perfect).  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is [abundant](#abundant) or [deficient](#deficient).

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: perfect_numbers.h perfect_numbers.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a classification for numbers based on their aliquot sum. Let's think through this carefully.

Since we're dealing with positive integers, we need to calculate the sum of proper divisors (excluding the number itself) and compare it to the number to determine if it's perfect, abundant, or deficient.

However, the instructions mention that depending on the language track, we may need to implement classification for all three types. Since the function signatures aren't provided, I'll assume we need to implement a function that can classify numbers into these categories.

Let's add an enum to the header file to represent the classification types, and implement a function to classify numbers.

Wait, the files are nearly empty, so we need to define the interface first.

Here's the plan:
1. Add an enum class to perfect_numbers.h to represent the classification
2. Add a function declaration that takes a number and returns its classification
3. Implement the function in perfect_numbers.cpp

Here are the necessary changes:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int64_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation in perfect_numbers.cpp, we need to calculate the aliquot sum and compare it to the number to determine the classification.
Since numbers can be large, we need an efficient way to find all proper divisors.
However, for now, we can use a straightforward approach by iterating up to the square root of the number.

Wait, but we need to be careful about edge cases:
1. The number must be positive (according to the instructions)
2. What about 1? Its proper divisors sum to 0, which is less than 1, so it's deficient

Here's the implementation:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 separately, as it has no proper divisors other than possibly itself which we exclude
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor for numbers > 1
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            // Add the complementary divisor if it's different
            std::int64_t complement = number / i;
            if (complement != i) {
                sum += complement;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to include <stdexcept> for std::domain_error
2. We need to handle numbers correctly, especially edge cases
3. The implementation uses a mathematical approach to find divisors up to the square root, which is efficient
4. We always start with sum = 1 because 1 is always a proper divisor for numbers > 1
5. We need to make sure not to include the number itself in the sum

This implementation should work for all positive integers. Let's test some cases:
- 6: divisors are 1, 2, 3 → sum=6 → perfect
- 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 → sum=28 → perfect
- 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → sum=16 > 12 → abundant
- 8: 1, 2, 4 → sum=7 < 8 → deficient
- 1: sum=0 < 1 → deficient (handled separately)

This matches the examples provided in the instructions.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle the requirements. Let's fix the issues:

1. The function signature in the header needs to be consistent
2. We need to ensure all types are appropriate
3. Let's make sure the implementation is correct

Wait, the function needs to be visible, and the implementation needs to be correct. Let's fix the implementation to handle numbers properly.

However, the implementation seems correct, but perhaps there are some issues with integer types or edge cases.

Wait, the number can be up to 2^63-1 which is very large, and using sqrt which returns a double may not be precise enough for large integers. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary fixes:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 separately, as it has no proper divisors other than possibly itself which we exclude
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor for numbers > 1
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            // Add the complementary divisor if it's different
            std::int64_t complement = number / i;
            if (complement != i) {
                sum += complement;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 separately
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1;
    // To avoid precision issues with large numbers, we can use integer square root
    std::int64_t i = 2;
    while (i * i <= number) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t complement = number / i;
            if (complement != i) {
                sum += complement;
            }
        }
        ++i;
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

```

This implementation uses integer arithmetic to avoid precision issues with floating point numbers when dealing with large integers. It's more reliable.

However, there's a potential issue: for very large numbers, this could be slow, but it should work within the constraints. Let's test some cases:
- 6: i goes up to 2 (2*2=4 <=6)
  i=2: 6%2==0 → sum +=2, complement=3 → sum +=3 → sum=1+2+3=6
  Which matches
- 28: i goes up to 5 (5*5=25 <=28)
  i=2: 28%2==0 → sum +=2, complement=14 → sum +=14 → sum=1+2+14=17
  i=4: 28%4==0 → sum +=4, complement=7 → sum +=7 → sum=17+4+7=28
  Which matches
- 12: i goes up to 3 (3*3=9 <=12)
  i=2: 12%2==0 → sum +=2, complement=6 → sum +=6 → sum=1+2+6=9
  i=3: 12%3==0 → sum +=3, complement=4 → sum +=4 → sum=9+3+4=16
  Which matches
- 8: i goes up to 2 (2*2=4 <=8)
  i=2: 8%2==0 → sum +=2, complement=4 → sum +=4 → sum=1+2+4=7
  Which matches

This implementation correctly handles these cases. Let's also test 1 which is handled separately:
- 1: immediately returns deficient, which matches

This implementation should now be correct and reliable.
