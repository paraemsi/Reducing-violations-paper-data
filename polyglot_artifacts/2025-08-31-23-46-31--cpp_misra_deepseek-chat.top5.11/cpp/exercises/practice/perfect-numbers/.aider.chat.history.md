#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of [perfect](#perfect), [abundant](#abundant), or [deficient](#deficient) based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The _aliquot sum_ is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of `15` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.  
####   
#### ## Perfect  
####   
#### A number is perfect when it equals its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `6` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`  
#### - `28` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`  
####   
#### ## Abundant  
####   
#### A number is abundant when it is less than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `12` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
#### - `24` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36`  
####   
#### ## Deficient  
####   
#### A number is deficient when it is greater than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `8` is a deficient number because `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`  
#### - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is [perfect](#perfect).  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is [abundant](#abundant) or [deficient](#deficient).

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: perfect_numbers.cpp perfect_numbers.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. We need to implement a classification for numbers based on their aliquot sum. Let's think through this carefully.

Since we need to determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient, we'll need a function that can classify a number into one of these categories. Let's implement this.

First, we need to include the necessary headers and define an enumeration type to represent the classification.

However, the instructions mention using fixed-width integer types, so we'll need to include <cstdint>.
Also, we need to be careful about integer types to follow the rules.

Here's the plan:
1. Add an enum class to represent the classification
2. Implement a function that calculates the aliquot sum
3. Compare the aliquot sum to the number to classify it

Wait, the instructions say to determine if a number is perfect, but depending on the track, we may need to implement classification for abundant and deficient as well.
Since it's not clear, we'll implement all three to be safe.

Let's implement:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int64_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the classify function in perfect_numbers.cpp:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t aliquot_sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            aliquot_sum += i;
            // Add the complementary divisor if it's different
            std::int64_t complement = number / i;
            if (complement != i) {
                aliquot_sum += complement;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (aliquot_sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (aliquot_sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to be careful about integer types. Since number is std::int64_t, all operations should use compatible types
2. We need to include <cmath> for std::sqrt
3. We need to handle edge cases like 1 which has no proper divisors other than itself, but according to the definition, its aliquot sum is 0 (sum of factors not including the number itself)
   Wait, but 1's factors are just 1, and we're not including the number itself, so aliquot sum should be 0
   So 1 > 0, which makes it deficient, which matches the implementation above

This implementation should work, but let's test our logic:
- For number = 6: divisors are 1, 2, 3 → sum = 6 → perfect
- For number = 12: divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → sum = 16 → abundant
- For number = 8: divisors are 1, 2, 4 → sum = 7 → deficient

This matches the examples. Let's proceed.

I understand. Let's fix the implementation to ensure it correctly handles all cases, including numbers that may be too large and edge cases. The implementation needs to be efficient and correct.

The main issue is that for numbers where the square root is a whole number, we might be adding it twice. Let's fix that.

Wait, in the implementation, we're checking if the complement is different from i, which should prevent that. But let's test:
For number = 4: i goes up to 2
i=2: number%2 ==0 → aliquot_sum +=2
complement=4/2=2 → which equals i, so we don't add it again
aliquot_sum=1+2=3
Which matches: 1+2=3 <4 → deficient

This seems correct.

However, there's a potential issue with integer overflow when number is very large. Let's make sure to use appropriate types.

Wait, the function signature uses std::int64_t, which should be fine for most cases.

Let's fix the implementation to be more precise:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t aliquot_sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            aliquot_sum += i;
            // Add the complementary divisor if it's different
            std::int64_t complement = number / i;
            if (complement != i) {
                aliquot_sum += complement;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (aliquot_sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (aliquot_sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Number must be positive");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 separately
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t aliquot_sum = 1; // Start with 1 which is always a divisor
    // We can optimize by going up to the square root
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            aliquot_sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                aliquot_sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (aliquot_sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (aliquot_sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue when number is a perfect square. Let's test with number=4:
i=2: 4%2==0 → aliquot_sum +=2 → 1+2=3
other_divisor=4/2=2 which equals i → don't add again
aliquot_sum=3 which is correct

This matches our earlier analysis, so it's correct.

This implementation should now work for all cases:
1. Throws an exception for non-positive numbers
2. Correctly classifies 1 as deficient (aliquot sum is 0, but we start at 1? Wait, that's not right)
   But 1's proper divisors are none (since we don't include the number itself), so aliquot sum should be 0
   So we need to fix that

Wait, the implementation starts aliquot_sum at 1, which is incorrect for number=1
But we handle number=1 separately, which returns deficient, which is correct
But the implementation would be wrong if we didn't handle it separately

Actually, for number=1, the loop never runs, and aliquot_sum starts at 1
But 1 > 0, which would make it abundant, which is wrong
So our special case is correct

Wait, but the aliquot sum of 1 should be 0, not 1
So we need to start at 0 for number >1
But then we need to always include 1 as a divisor when number >1
Let's fix this

Wait, the implementation is correct because we have a special case for number=1
So it's fine

This implementation should now be correct. Let's run with it.
