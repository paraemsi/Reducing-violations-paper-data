#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement the classic method for composing secret messages called a square code.  
####   
#### Given an English text, output the encoded version of that text.  
####   
#### First, the input is normalized: the spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the message is down-cased.  
####   
#### Then, the normalized characters are broken into rows.  
#### These rows can be regarded as forming a rectangle when printed with intervening newlines.  
####   
#### For example, the sentence  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "If man was meant to stay on the ground, god would have given us roots."  
#### ```  
####   
#### is normalized to:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "ifmanwasmeanttostayonthegroundgodwouldhavegivenusroots"  
#### ```  
####   
#### The plaintext should be organized into a rectangle as square as possible.  
#### The size of the rectangle should be decided by the length of the message.  
####   
#### If `c` is the number of columns and `r` is the number of rows, then for the rectangle `r` x `c` find the smallest possible integer `c` such that:  
####   
#### - `r * c >= length of message`,  
#### - and `c >= r`,  
#### - and `c - r <= 1`.  
####   
#### Our normalized text is 54 characters long, dictating a rectangle with `c = 8` and `r = 7`:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "ifmanwas"  
#### "meanttos"  
#### "tayonthe"  
#### "groundgo"  
#### "dwouldha"  
#### "vegivenu"  
#### "sroots  "  
#### ```  
####   
#### The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right.  
####   
#### The message above is coded as:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvsfearwermayoogoanouuiontnnlvtwttddesaohghnsseoau"  
#### ```  
####   
#### Output the encoded text in chunks that fill perfect rectangles `(r X c)`, with `c` chunks of `r` length, separated by spaces.  
#### For phrases that are `n` characters short of the perfect rectangle, pad each of the last `n` chunks with a single trailing space.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn  sseoau "  
#### ```  
####   
#### Notice that were we to stack these, we could visually decode the ciphertext back in to the original message:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvs"  
#### "fearwer"  
#### "mayoogo"  
#### "anouuio"  
#### "ntnnlvt"  
#### "wttddes"  
#### "aohghn "  
#### "sseoau "  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: crypto_square.cpp crypto_square.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
