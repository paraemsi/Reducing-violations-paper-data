#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a fancy store.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value and weight.  
#### Bob would gladly take all of the items, but his knapsack can only hold so much weight.  
#### Bob has to carefully consider which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to determine which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized, taking into account the knapsack's carrying capacity.  
####   
#### Items will be represented as a list of items.  
#### Each item will have a weight and value.  
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10  
#### ```  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.cpp knapsack.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a solution to the classic 0/1 knapsack problem. Since Bob can take each item at most once, and we need to maximize the total value without exceeding the maximum weight, we can use dynamic programming.

However, the implementation needs to be efficient. Since weights can be up to a certain maximum, and the number of items can be large, we need to be careful about the approach.

Since all values are positive, and we need to maximize the total value, we can use a dynamic programming approach where dp[i] represents the maximum value achievable with weight i.

However, the maximum weight can be up to a certain limit, which isn't specified, but we need to be efficient. Let's assume it can be large, but within reasonable limits.

Wait, the implementation needs to be in C++ and follow the given rules. Let's proceed.

First, we need to add a function to the knapsack namespace that solves this problem. Let's add it to the header and implement it.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Add the function declaration to knapsack.h
2. Implement the function in knapsack.cpp
3. Follow all the given rules

Here are the planned changes:

knapsack.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    int weight;
    int value;
};

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
=======
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    std::int32_t weight;
    std::int32_t value;
};

std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items);

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation in knapsack.cpp, we'll use dynamic programming where dp[i] is the maximum value achievable with weight i.
Since weights can be up to maximumWeight, which can be large, but we need to be efficient.

Wait, the maximum weight can be up to 2000? Or more? The problem doesn't specify, but we need to be efficient.
Since all values are positive, we can use a dynamic programming approach.

Here's the implementation:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"

namespace knapsack
{

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty()) 
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i] is the maximum value for weight i
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximumWeight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in dp array
    std::int32_t maxValue = 0;
    for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximumWeight; ++w)
    {
        if (dp[w] > maxValue)
        {
            maxValue = dp[w];
        }
    }
    
    return maxValue;
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to ensure all operations follow the given rules
2. All types are appropriate (using std::int32_t)
3. Parentheses are used correctly
4. All if/else statements have compound statements

This implementation should work within the constraints:
- It processes each item and updates the dp array in reverse to ensure each item is used at most once
- The time complexity is O(n * maximumWeight), which is efficient enough for reasonable maximumWeight values
- It always finds the maximum value achievable within the weight constraint

However, if maximumWeight is very large (like 1,000,000) and there are many items, this could be too slow, but the problem doesn't specify any constraints, so we'll assume it's fine.

This implementation should work for the provided example:
Items: weight 5 value 10, weight 4 value 40, weight 6 value 30, weight 4 value 50
Maximum weight: 10
The maximum value should be 90 (items 2 and 4: 40 + 50)

I understand. The implementation looks correct, but let's make sure it follows all the given rules. Let's fix any potential issues:

1. All if/else statements must have compound statements (use {})
2. Use parentheses to ensure proper operator precedence
3. Ensure all types are appropriate

Wait, the implementation seems to already follow most rules, but let's check:
1. All if statements have {} around their bodies
2. The comparison in the if statement needs to be parenthesized according to the rules

Here are the necessary fixes:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty()) 
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i] is the maximum value for weight i
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximumWeight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in dp array
    std::int32_t maxValue = 0;
    for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximumWeight; ++w)
    {

        {
            maxValue = dp[w];
        }
    }
    
    return maxValue;
}

std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)

    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i] is the maximum value for weight i

            {
                dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)] = (dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w - item.weight)]) + (item.value);
            }
        }
    }

        }
    }
    
    return maxValue;
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to cast indices to std::size_t when accessing the vector to avoid signed/unsigned issues
2. All expressions are properly parenthesized according to the rules
3. All if statements have compound statements

Wait, the maximumWeight could be 0, which is valid, and our implementation should handle that correctly.
Since we're creating a vector of size maximumWeight + 1, if maximumWeight is 0, the size will be 1, which is correct.

This implementation should now follow all the given rules:
1. All types are fixed-width integer types
2. All assignments are between compatible types (we added explicit casts where necessary)
3. All expressions are properly parenthesized
4. All if statements have compound statements
5. No character numerical values are used

This should now work correctly while adhering to all the specified rules. Let's test it with the provided example:
Items: weight 5 value 10, weight 4 value 40, weight 6 value 30, weight 4 value 50
Maximum weight: 10
The maximum value should be 90 (items 2 and 4: 40 + 50)

This change renames `maximumValue` to `maximum_value` to match what the tests expect. The implementation remains the same, which uses dynamic programming to solve the 0/1 knapsack problem efficiently.

However, I added an additional check for when `maximumWeight` is 0, which should always return 0 since no items can be selected (all items have positive weight, and the knapsack can't hold any weight).

This implementation should now pass the tests:
- It correctly handles cases where the knapsack is empty
- It processes items in a way that each item is used at most once
- It always finds the maximum value within the weight constraint
- The function name matches what the tests expect

Let's hope this resolves the compilation errors. The implementation is correct for the problem:
- For the example provided, it will select items with weights 4 and 4 (values 40 and 50) to get a total value of 90 within the weight limit of 10
- It uses a standard dynamic programming approach for the 0/1 knapsack problem

The implementation looks correct, but there's a potential issue when maximumWeight is 0. Let's fix that and ensure all indices are valid:

Wait, when maximumWeight is 0, we're creating a vector of size 1 (0 + 1), which is correct.
But we need to make sure we don't access out of bounds indices.

Actually, the implementation seems correct, but let's make sure:
1. All indices are valid
2. All if statements have compound statements
3. All expressions are properly parenthesized

Wait, when maximumWeight is 0, the inner loop condition `w >= item.weight` may never be true if item.weight > 0, which it always is (since weights are positive)
So it's fine.

However, to be thorough, let's fix any potential issues:

Here's the revised implementation:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)

    if (items.empty()) 
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Handle case where maximumWeight is 0
    if (maximumWeight == 0)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i] is the maximum value for weight i
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(static_cast<std::size_t>(maximumWeight) + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {

            {
                dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)] = (dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w - item.weight)]) + (item.value);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in dp array
    // Since dp is initialized to 0, and values are always positive, the maximum will be at some index
    // We can simply take the last element, but to be safe, we'll find the maximum
    std::int32_t maxValue = 0;
    for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximumWeight; ++w)
    {
        if ((dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)]) > maxValue)
        {
            maxValue = dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)];
        }
    }
    
    return maxValue;
}

} // namespace knapsack

    {

    // Create a DP array where dp[i] is the maximum value for weight i
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(static_cast<std::size_t>(maximumWeight) + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {

            // Calculate potential new value
            std::int32_t newValue = (dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w - item.weight)]) + (item.value);
            if ((dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)]) < newValue)
            {
                dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)] = newValue;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The maximum value will be the maximum in the dp array
    // Since all values are non-negative, and we're always filling up to maximumWeight
    std::int32_t maxValue = 0;
    for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximumWeight; ++w)
    {
        if ((dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)]) > maxValue)
        {
            maxValue = dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)];

```

This implementation:
1. Combines the checks for empty items and maximumWeight being 0
2. Uses a temporary variable `newValue` to make the condition clearer
3. Still follows all the given rules:
   - Uses fixed-width integer types
   - Properly parenthesizes expressions
   - Uses compound statements for all if blocks
   - No character numerical values are used
   - All indices are properly cast to std::size_t

This should now work correctly for all test cases, including:
- Empty list of items
- Maximum weight of 0
- Regular cases where items need to be selected to maximize value within weight constraints

The implementation uses dynamic programming where `dp[w]` represents the maximum value that can be achieved with weight `w`. By processing items and updating the dp array in reverse order, we ensure each item is used at most once.
