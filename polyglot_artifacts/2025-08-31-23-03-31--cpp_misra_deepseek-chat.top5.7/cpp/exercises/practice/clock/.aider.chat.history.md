#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a clock that handles times without dates.  
####   
#### You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.  
####   
#### Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.h clock.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

I understand. Let's implement a clock that handles times without dates, allowing addition and subtraction of minutes, and ensuring that two clocks representing the same time are equal.

Since we need to represent time in hours and minutes, and handle operations that can wrap around days, we'll need to normalize the time to always be within 0-23 hours and 0-59 minutes.

Let's implement this by:
1. Storing the total minutes since 00:00
2. Normalizing the total minutes to always be within 0-1439 (since 24*60=1440 minutes per day)
3. Providing methods to add and subtract minutes
4. Implementing equality comparison

However, the instructions don't specify the exact interface, so I'll need to make some assumptions:
1. A clock can be constructed from hours and minutes
2. It should support adding and subtracting minutes
3. It should support equality comparison
4. It should provide a string representation

Since we're in C++, we'll need to define a Clock class with appropriate methods.

Wait, the files provided are empty, so we need to define everything from scratch.

Here's the plan:
1. Define a Clock class in clock.h
2. Implement its methods in clock.cpp
3. Make sure to handle all operations correctly

Let's start with clock.h:

clock.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
=======
#if !defined(CLOCK_H)
#define CLOCK_H

#include <string>
#include <cstdint>

namespace date_independent {

class clock {
private:
    std::int32_t total_minutes;
    clock(std::int32_t minutes);
    
public:
    static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
    clock plus(std::int32_t minutes) const;
    clock minus(std::int32_t minutes) const;
    operator std::string() const;
    bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
    bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;
};

}  // namespace date_independent

#endif // CLOCK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the methods in clock.cpp:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

namespace date_independent {

}  // namespace date_independent
=======
#include "clock.h"
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {

clock::clock(std::int32_t minutes) : total_minutes(minutes) {
}

clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
    // Convert everything to minutes and normalize
    std::int32_t total = (hours * 60) + minutes;
    // Handle negative values by adding enough days to make it positive
    total %= 1440;
    if (total < 0) {
        total += 1440;
    }
    return clock(total);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    std::int32_t new_total = (total_minutes + minutes) % 1440;
    if (new_total < 0) {
        new_total += 1440;
    }
    return clock(new_total);
}

clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    return plus(-minutes);
}

clock::operator std::string() const {
    std::int32_t hours = (total_minutes / 60) % 24;
    std::int32_t minutes = total_minutes % 60;
    // Handle cases where hours could be negative? But total_minutes is always positive due to normalization
    if (hours < 0) {
        hours += 24;
    }
    
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << hours << ":"
        << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << minutes;
    return oss.str();
}

bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
    return (total_minutes == other.total_minutes);
}

bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
    return !(*this == other);
}

}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The total_minutes is always kept within 0-1439 through normalization
2. The plus and minus operations always result in a valid time
3. The string representation always shows two digits for hours and minutes
4. We use std::int32_t to ensure we have enough range for operations (even with large numbers of minutes added/subtracted)

This implementation should handle:
- Adding and subtracting minutes
- Wrapping around days correctly
- Equality comparison
- String representation in HH:MM format

However, the implementation of plus and minus needs to ensure that the total minutes always stays within 0-1439, which it does by using modulo 1440 and adjusting for negative values.

This implementation should meet all the requirements:
1. Handle times without dates
2. Add and subtract minutes
3. Two clocks representing the same time are equal (they have the same total_minutes)
4. Uses appropriate types according to the rules provided

Let me know if you have any questions or if there are any issues with this implementation.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to ensure it follows the provided rules. Let's fix the issues:

1. The constructor should be public to allow for certain operations
2. We need to ensure all operations are correct
3. The implementation needs to handle all cases properly

Wait, the clock needs to be value-based, and the tests may expect certain behavior. Let's fix the implementation.

Here are the necessary changes:

clock.h
```cpp

    clock(std::int32_t minutes);
    
public:
    static clock at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes);
    clock plus(std::int32_t minutes) const;
    clock minus(std::int32_t minutes) const;
    operator std::string() const;
    bool operator==(const clock& other) const;

    bool operator==(const clock& other) const;
    bool operator!=(const clock& other) const;

```

Now for clock.cpp, we need to ensure all operations are correct:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "clock.h"

#include <sstream>

namespace date_independent {

    std::int32_t total = (hours * 60) + minutes;
    // Handle negative values by adding enough days to make it positive
    total %= 1440;
    if (total < 0) {
        total += 1440;
    }
    return clock(total);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {

    if (new_total < 0) {

    }
    return clock(new_total);

    return !(*this == other);
}

}  // namespace date_independent

namespace date_independent {

clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {

    std::int32_t total_minutes_from_input = (hours * 60) + minutes;

    if (total_minutes_from_input < 0) {
        total_minutes_from_input += 1440;
    }
    return clock(total_minutes_from_input);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    // Add minutes and normalize
    std::int32_t new_total = total_minutes + minutes;
    new_total %= 1440;
    if (new_total < 0) {
        new_total += 1440;
    }
    return clock(new_total);
}

clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    // Subtract minutes by adding negative
    return plus(-minutes);
}

clock::operator std::string() const {
    // total_minutes is always between 0-1439
    std::int32_t hours = total_minutes / 60;

    // Since total_minutes is always positive, hours will be between 0-23

        << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << mins;
    return oss.str();
}

bool clock::operator==(const clock& other) const {
    return (total_minutes == other.total_minutes);
}

bool clock::operator!=(const clock& other) const {
    return (total_minutes != other.total_minutes);
}

}  // namespace date_independent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The total_minutes is always normalized to be between 0 and 1439, which ensures valid times
2. The implementation of plus and minus correctly handles wrapping around days
3. The string conversion always produces valid HH:MM format
4. The equality operators are correctly implemented

This implementation should now work correctly:
1. It can handle adding and subtracting minutes, including those that cross day boundaries
2. Two clocks with the same time will be equal (they have the same total_minutes)
3. The time is always represented in a valid format

However, there's a potential issue with very large numbers of minutes being added or subtracted. But since we're using modulo arithmetic, it should handle any integer value correctly.

This implementation follows the provided rules:
1. Uses std::int32_t consistently
2. All operations are appropriate
3. Parentheses are used where necessary
4. All if statements use compound statements
5. No character numerical values are used

Let me know if there are any further issues.

I understand. The implementation needs to ensure that the total_minutes is always within the valid range (0-1439) to represent a valid time. Let's fix any potential issues:

1. The implementation needs to handle large numbers correctly
2. We need to ensure that when adding or subtracting minutes, the result is always normalized
3. The implementation should be robust

However, the implementation looks correct. Let's make sure all operations properly normalize the time:

Wait, when adding or subtracting very large numbers, the intermediate result could overflow. To prevent this, we need to handle the modulo operation carefully.

But since we're using 32-bit integers, and 1440 minutes per day, even with large numbers, it should be fine within the range of std::int32_t.

However, to be precise, let's ensure that the implementation always normalizes correctly:

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Let's test the logic:
1. When creating a clock, we normalize the total minutes
2. When adding or subtracting, we normalize again
3. This ensures the total_minutes is always between 0-1439

But perhaps there's an issue with the modulo operation when dealing with negative numbers:
total_minutes_from_input %= 1440;
If total_minutes_from_input is negative, the result will be negative, which we then adjust by adding 1440

This seems correct.

Wait, the implementation of plus() uses:
new_total %= 1440;
But if new_total is very large, this could be an issue, but modulo handles that correctly.

Actually, the implementation seems correct. Perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Wait, the user may be seeing compilation errors because the constructor is private. But the static 'at' method can access it since it's a member of the class.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Let's make sure all operations are precise:

Actually, to ensure we always have a valid time, we need to make sure total_minutes is always between 0 and 1439 inclusive.

Let's modify the implementation to always normalize the time:

Wait, the implementation already does this. Let's add some debugging or ensure it's always correct.

Actually, let's be very precise about the normalization:

Here's a revised implementation that always ensures total_minutes is within 0-1439:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
    // First, convert to total minutes
    std::int32_t total_minutes_from_input = (hours * 60) + minutes;
    // Normalize to be within 0-1439
    // Handle negative by adding enough days
    total_minutes_from_input %= 1440;
    if (total_minutes_from_input < 0) {
        total_minutes_from_input += 1440;
    }
    return clock(total_minutes_from_input);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    // Add minutes and normalize
    std::int32_t new_total = total_minutes + minutes;
    new_total %= 1440;
    if (new_total < 0) {
        new_total += 1440;
    }
    return clock(new_total);
}

clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    // Subtract minutes by adding negative
    return plus(-minutes);
}
=======
clock clock::at(std::int32_t hours, std::int32_t minutes) {
    // Convert everything to total minutes
    std::int32_t total_minutes_from_input = (hours * 60) + minutes;
    // Normalize to be within 0-1439
    // Use modulo to handle large values, and adjust for negative
    total_minutes_from_input %= 1440;
    if (total_minutes_from_input < 0) {
        total_minutes_from_input += 1440;
    }
    return clock(total_minutes_from_input);
}

clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    // Add minutes and normalize
    // To prevent potential overflow, we can compute modulo in steps, but with 32-bit integers it's fine
    std::int32_t new_total = (total_minutes + minutes) % 1440;
    if (new_total < 0) {
        new_total += 1440;
    }
    return clock(new_total);
}

clock clock::minus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    // Reuse plus by negating the minutes to subtract
    return plus(-minutes);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, this is essentially the same as before. Let's think about potential issues:
1. Integer overflow when adding very large numbers of minutes
2. But since we're using modulo 1440, it should be fine

Wait, to prevent overflow, we can compute the addition differently:
total_minutes + minutes could overflow if both are very large
But since total_minutes is always between 0-1439, and minutes can be any 32-bit integer, we need to handle this carefully

Let's compute the sum modulo 1440 without potential overflow:

Wait, we can compute it as:
(total_minutes % 1440 + minutes % 1440) % 1440
But this may not be correct for negative values

Actually, to avoid overflow, let's compute it differently:
((total_minutes % 1440) + (minutes % 1440) + 1440) % 1440
But this may not always be correct

Wait, since total_minutes is always between 0-1439, we can do:
std::int32_t new_total = (total_minutes + (minutes % 1440) + 1440) % 1440;
But this needs to be adjusted

Actually, the best way is to cast to 64-bit integers to prevent overflow:
std::int64_t new_total = static_cast<std::int64_t>(total_minutes) + minutes;
new_total %= 1440;
if (new_total < 0) {
    new_total += 1440;
}
return clock(static_cast<std::int32_t>(new_total));

But this may violate the rules about appropriate assignments between numeric types

Wait, according to the rules, we need to be careful with assignments between different sizes
Since we're casting from int64_t to int32_t, and new_total is always between 0-1439, which fits in int32_t, it's okay

Let's implement this fix:

clock.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    // Add minutes and normalize
    // To prevent potential overflow, we can compute modulo in steps, but with 32-bit integers it's fine
    std::int32_t new_total = (total_minutes + minutes) % 1440;
    if (new_total < 0) {
        new_total += 1440;
    }
    return clock(new_total);
}
=======
clock clock::plus(std::int32_t minutes) const {
    // Use 64-bit integers to prevent overflow during addition
    std::int64_t new_total = static_cast<std::int64_t>(total_minutes) + minutes;
    new_total %= 1440;
    if (new_total < 0) {
        new_total += 1440;
    }
    // new_total is between 0-1439, which fits in int32_t
    return clock(static_cast<std::int32_t>(new_total));
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This should prevent any potential overflow issues when adding very large numbers of minutes.
