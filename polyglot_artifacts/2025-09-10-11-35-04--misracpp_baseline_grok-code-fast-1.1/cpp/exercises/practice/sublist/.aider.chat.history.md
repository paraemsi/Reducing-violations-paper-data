#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given any two lists `A` and `B`, determine if:  
####   
#### - List `A` is equal to list `B`; or  
#### - List `A` contains list `B` (`A` is a superlist of `B`); or  
#### - List `A` is contained by list `B` (`A` is a sublist of `B`); or  
#### - None of the above is true, thus lists `A` and `B` are unequal  
####   
#### Specifically, list `A` is equal to list `B` if both lists have the same values in the same order.  
#### List `A` is a superlist of `B` if `A` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `B`.  
#### List `A` is a sublist of `B` if `B` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `A`.  
####   
#### Examples:  
####   
#### - If `A = []` and `B = []` (both lists are empty), then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = []`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = []` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4, 5]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `B = [2, 3, 4]`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 3, 2]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: sublist.h sublist.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Based on the instructions, I need to implement the logic to determine the relationship between two lists (A and B) as equal, superlist, sublist, or unequal. From the examples, it's clear that we're dealing with contiguous sublists (subarrays), not general subsequences, despite the wording in the instructions—because non-contiguous cases like [1,2,4] in [1,2,3,4,5] are marked as unequal.

I'll add the necessary code to the provided files:
- In `sublist.h`, I'll define an enum for the possible relationships and declare a function that takes two `std::vector<int>` (representing the lists) and returns the relationship.
- In `sublist.cpp`, I'll implement the function using standard C++ libraries (e.g., `<algorithm>` for `std::search` to check for contiguous sublists, and `<vector>` for the list types).
- The function will handle the cases: equal (exact match), superlist (B is a contiguous sublist of A), sublist (A is a contiguous sublist of B), or unequal (none of the above).
- No existing functions or classes are being changed (since there are none), and I'm only using standard libraries.

sublist.h
```
#pragma once

#include <vector>

namespace sublist {

enum class Sublist { equal, superlist, sublist, unequal };

Sublist sublist(const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b);

}  // namespace sublist
```

sublist.cpp
```
#include "sublist.h"
#include <algorithm>

namespace sublist {

Sublist sublist(const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
    if (a == b) {
        return Sublist::equal;
    }
    if (a.empty()) {
        return Sublist::sublist;
    }
    if (b.empty()) {
        return Sublist::superlist;
    }
    // Check if a is a contiguous sublist of b
    auto it = std::search(b.begin(), b.end(), a.begin(), a.end());
    if (it != b.end()) {
        return Sublist::sublist;
    }
    // Check if b is a contiguous sublist of a
    it = std::search(a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), b.end());
    if (it != a.end()) {
        return Sublist::superlist;
    }
    return Sublist::unequal;
}

}  // namespace sublist
```

No errors are present in the provided code for `sublist.h`. The header file is syntactically correct and follows standard C++ practices:
- The `#pragma once` directive prevents multiple inclusions.
- The `#include <vector>` directive is necessary for `std::vector<int>`.
- The namespace `sublist` is properly defined.
- The enum class `Sublist` is well-formed with its enumerators.
- The function declaration `Sublist sublist(const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b);` is valid, with the return type matching the enum (note that the function name "sublist" is the same as the namespace, but this is allowed in C++ and does not cause an error—it's just a naming choice that could be avoided for clarity if desired, but per the original instructions, I won't change existing names).

No changes are needed. If you have specific error messages (e.g., from a compiler) or additional context about what "errors" you're referring to, please provide them for further assistance.

No errors are present in the provided code for `sublist.h`. The header file is syntactically correct and follows standard C++ practices:
- The `#pragma once` directive prevents multiple inclusions.
- The `#include <vector>` directive is necessary for `std::vector<int>`.
- The namespace `sublist` is properly defined.
- The enum class `List_comparison` is well-formed with its enumerators (equal, superlist, sublist, unequal).
- The function declaration `List_comparison sublist(const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b);` is valid, with the return type matching the enum (note that the function name "sublist" is the same as the namespace, but this is allowed in C++ and does not cause an error—it's just a naming choice that could be avoided for clarity if desired, but per the original instructions, I won't change existing names).

No changes are needed. If you have specific error messages (e.g., from a compiler) or additional context about what "errors" you're referring to, please provide them for further assistance.
