#### # Introduction  
####   
#### After years of filling out forms and waiting, you've finally acquired your banking license.  
#### This means you are now officially eligible to open your own bank, hurray!  
####   
#### Your first priority is to get the IT systems up and running.  
#### After a day of hard work, you can already open and close accounts, as well as handle withdrawals and deposits.  
####   
#### Since you couldn't be bothered writing tests, you invite some friends to help test the system.  
#### However, after just five minutes, one of your friends claims they've lost money!  
#### While you're confident your code is bug-free, you start looking through the logs to investigate.  
####   
#### Ah yes, just as you suspected, your friend is at fault!  
#### They shared their test credentials with another friend, and together they conspired to make deposits and withdrawals from the same account _in parallel_.  
#### Who would do such a thing?  
####   
#### While you argue that it's physically _impossible_ for someone to access their account in parallel, your friend smugly notifies you that the banking rules _require_ you to support this.  
#### Thus, no parallel banking support, no go-live signal.  
#### Sighing, you create a mental note to work on this tomorrow.  
#### This will set your launch date back at _least_ one more day, but well...  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
####   
#### As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), your bank software must allow accounts to be safely accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.  
#### For example, there may be many deposits and withdrawals occurring in parallel; you need to ensure there are no [race conditions][wikipedia] between when you read the account balance and set the new balance.  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
####   
#### [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.cpp bank_account.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a thread-safe bank account class that supports deposits, withdrawals, and can be closed. Since multiple threads can access the account simultaneously, we need to use synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

Since this is C++, we'll use a mutex to protect access to the account balance and status. Let's implement this:

1. Add necessary includes
2. Add member variables for balance and account status (open/closed)
3. Add a mutex to synchronize access
4. Implement the required functionality

However, the provided files are quite minimal, so we need to add the interface and implementation.

Wait, the class is currently empty. Let's define the interface first.

Here are the necessary operations:
1. Open/close the account
2. Deposit money
3. Withdraw money
4. Get balance

Since the account can be closed, operations should fail when it's closed.

Let's implement:

Here are the planned changes:

bank_account.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
=======
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <mutex>

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {
public:
    Bankaccount();
    void open();
    void close();
    void deposit(std::int64_t amount);
    void withdraw(std::int64_t amount);
    std::int64_t balance() const;
    
private:
    mutable std::mutex mtx;
    std::int64_t bal;
    bool is_open;
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in bank_account.cpp:

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "bank_account.h"

namespace Bankaccount {}
=======
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : bal(0), is_open(false) {
}

void Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is already open");
    }
    is_open = true;
    bal = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is not open");
    }
    is_open = false;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    bal += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    if (amount > bal) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    bal -= amount;
}

std::int64_t Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!is_open) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
    }
    return bal;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to ensure all operations are thread-safe, which is why we use a mutex
2. We need to check if the account is open before performing operations
3. We need to validate amounts (positive values)
4. For withdrawals, we need to check if there are sufficient funds
5. All operations on a closed account should throw exceptions

This implementation ensures that:
1. Multiple threads can safely access the account without race conditions
2. The account can be opened and closed
3. Deposits and withdrawals are handled atomically
4. The balance is always consistent

However, the exact error messages may need to match what the tests expect, but since we don't have that information, we'll use generic messages. If the tests expect specific messages, we may need to adjust them later.

This implementation uses `std::int64_t` for the balance and amounts, which should be sufficient for monetary values. We're also using `std::mutex` and `std::lock_guard` for synchronization, which are standard in C++.

Let me know if you need any adjustments!

I understand. The issue is that the function signatures in the implementation don't match the declarations in the header. Let's fix that.

However, the implementation seems to be using `std::int64_t` which matches the header, so perhaps there's another issue. Maybe the tests expect different function signatures or behavior.

Wait, the instructions say:
1. Don't change the names of existing functions or classes
2. The implementation must be thread-safe
3. Operations against a closed account must fail

But the implementation seems correct. Maybe the tests expect different function signatures? Let's see:

Perhaps the tests expect the functions to return values or have different parameters. But the implementation matches the header.

Wait, the header uses `std::int64_t` which is correct according to the rules, but maybe the tests expect a different type? Or perhaps the implementation needs to be adjusted.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Maybe there are compilation issues. Let's ensure all necessary includes are present.

Wait, the implementation uses `std::runtime_error` which requires `<stdexcept>`, which is included. That's good.

Perhaps the issue is that the implementation needs to be in a specific namespace or have specific function signatures.

Since the instructions say not to change existing function names or classes, and our implementation matches the header, maybe there's another issue.

Wait, the class name in the header is `Bankaccount` (note the lowercase 'a' in 'account'), which matches the implementation.

Let's make sure all function signatures match exactly. They seem to.

Perhaps the tests expect different behavior:
1. When opening an account, it should set the balance to 0
2. When depositing or withdrawing, amounts should be positive
3. Withdrawals should not exceed the balance
4. All operations should be thread-safe

Our implementation seems to handle all these cases.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the implementation needs to throw specific exception types or messages. But the instructions don't specify that.

Perhaps the implementation needs to be adjusted to use the exact same types. Let's make sure we're using `std::int64_t` consistently.

Actually, everything looks correct. Maybe the error is elsewhere.

Wait, the implementation uses `std::lock_guard` which requires `<mutex>`, which is included in the header. That's good.

Perhaps the implementation needs to be in the exact namespace specified, which it is.

Since I can't see any issues, I'll assume the implementation is correct and the errors are elsewhere.

However, to be thorough, let's make sure all function signatures match exactly between the header and implementation:

Wait, the implementation seems to match the header:
- deposit takes std::int64_t
- withdraw takes std::int64_t
- balance returns std::int64_t

This matches the header.

Perhaps the issue is that the implementation needs to be in a specific file or have specific includes.

Since I can't see any actual errors, I'll provide the implementation as is, which seems correct.

However, to ensure everything is perfect, let's add some additional error checking and make sure all operations are properly synchronized.

Wait, the implementation already uses a mutex to protect all accesses, which is correct for thread safety.

Since I can't identify any issues, I'll provide the implementation as is.

If there are specific errors, please provide more details about what they are.
