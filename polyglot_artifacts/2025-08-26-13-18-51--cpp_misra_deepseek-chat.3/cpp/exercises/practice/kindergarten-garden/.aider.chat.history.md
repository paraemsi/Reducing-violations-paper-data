#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The kindergarten class is learning about growing plants.  
#### The teacher thought it would be a good idea to give the class seeds to plant and grow in the dirt.  
#### To this end, the children have put little cups along the window sills and planted one type of plant in each cup.  
#### The children got to pick their favorites from four available types of seeds: grass, clover, radishes, and violets.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to, given a diagram, determine which plants each child in the kindergarten class is responsible for.  
####   
#### There are 12 children in the class:  
####   
#### - Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve, Fred, Ginny, Harriet, Ileana, Joseph, Kincaid, and Larry.  
####   
#### Four different types of seeds are planted:  
####   
#### | Plant  | Diagram encoding |  
#### | ------ | ---------------- |  
#### | Grass  | G                |  
#### | Clover | C                |  
#### | Radish | R                |  
#### | Violet | V                |  
####   
#### Each child gets four cups, two on each row:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### ........................ # each dot represents a cup  
#### ........................  
#### ```  
####   
#### Their teacher assigns cups to the children alphabetically by their names, which means that Alice comes first and Larry comes last.  
####   
#### Here is an example diagram representing Alice's plants:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VR......................  
#### RG......................  
#### ```  
####   
#### In the first row, nearest the windows, she has a violet and a radish.  
#### In the second row she has a radish and some grass.  
####   
#### Your program will be given the plants from left-to-right starting with the row nearest the windows.  
#### From this, it should be able to determine which plants belong to each student.  
####   
#### For example, if it's told that the garden looks like so:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV  
#### VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then if asked for Alice's plants, it should provide:  
####   
#### - Violets, radishes, violets, radishes  
####   
#### While asking for Bob's plants would yield:  
####   
#### - Clover, grass, clover, clover  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: kindergarten_garden.cpp kindergarten_garden.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. Let's implement a solution to determine which plants each child is responsible for based on the given diagram. Since there are 12 children, and each child gets 4 cups (2 from each row), we need to parse the diagram accordingly.

The diagram consists of two lines, each with 2 * 12 = 24 characters (since each child gets 2 cups per row). We'll split each row into 12 parts, and for each child, take the appropriate cups from both rows.

Since the children are ordered alphabetically, we can map their names to indices:
Alice -> 0, Bob -> 1, ..., Larry -> 11

For each child at index i, their plants are at positions:
First row: 2*i and 2*i +1
Second row: 2*i and 2*i +1

Wait, but the diagram is given as a string, which we need to split into two rows.

Let's implement a function that takes a diagram and a child's name, and returns their plants.

However, the instructions may want to get all plants for all children, or just for a specific child. Since the function signatures aren't provided, I'll assume we need to implement a function that takes a diagram and returns a mapping from child names to their plants.

Wait, the files are empty, so we need to define the interface. Let's add a function that takes a diagram and returns a map from child names to a list of plants.

First, let's update the header file to include necessary includes and function declaration.

Here are the necessary changes:

kindergarten_garden.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#pragma once

namespace kindergarten_garden {

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
=======
#pragma once

#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

namespace kindergarten_garden {

std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> plants(const std::string& diagram);

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation in the cpp file, we need to parse the diagram and assign plants to each child:

kindergarten_garden.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "kindergarten_garden.h"

namespace kindergarten_garden {

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
=======
#include "kindergarten_garden.h"
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <sstream>
#include <algorithm>

namespace kindergarten_garden {

std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> plants(const std::string& diagram) {
    // Split the diagram into two rows
    std::istringstream iss(diagram);
    std::string first_row;
    std::string second_row;
    std::getline(iss, first_row);
    std::getline(iss, second_row);
    
    // List of children in order
    const std::vector<std::string> children = {
        "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David",
        "Eve", "Fred", "Ginny", "Harriet",
        "Ileana", "Joseph", "Kincaid", "Larry"
    };
    
    std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> result;
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < children.size(); ++i) {
        // For each child, get their plants from both rows
        const size_t index = 2 * i;
        std::vector<std::string> child_plants;
        
        // Get plants from first row
        char plant1_char = first_row[index];
        char plant2_char = first_row[index + 1];
        
        // Get plants from second row
        char plant3_char = second_row[index];
        char plant4_char = second_row[index + 1];
        
        // Helper lambda to convert char to plant name
        auto char_to_plant = [](char c) -> std::string {
            switch (c) {
                case 'G': return "grass";
                case 'C': return "clover";
                case 'R': return "radishes";
                case 'V': return "violets";
                default: return "";
            }
        };
        
        child_plants.push_back(char_to_plant(plant1_char));
        child_plants.push_back(char_to_plant(plant2_char));
        child_plants.push_back(char_to_plant(plant3_char));
        child_plants.push_back(char_to_plant(plant4_char));
        
        result[children[i]] = child_plants;
    }
    
    return result;
}

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, the example provided in the instructions seems to show that the function might be called to get plants for a specific child, but our implementation returns all plants for all children. But since the instructions are a bit ambiguous, and the function signature in the header file is fixed, we'll proceed with this approach.

Wait, the example says "if asked for Alice's plants" and "asking for Bob's plants", which suggests the function might take a child's name as a parameter. But the header file shows a function that only takes a diagram. Maybe the tests expect to get all plants at once.

Since we can't see the tests, we'll implement according to the provided function signature. If it needs to be different, we can adjust later.

This implementation should work by parsing the diagram and assigning plants to each child in order. Let's test the provided example:
- Alice (index 0) gets first two plants from first row and first two from second row
- Which would be 'V', 'R' from first row and 'V', 'R' from second row? Wait, the example says:
  "VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV" (first row)
  "VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV" (second row)

But according to the implementation, Alice's plants would be:
First row: indices 0,1 -> 'V', 'R'
Second row: indices 0,1 -> 'V', 'R'
Which matches: Violets, radishes, violets, radishes

Bob's plants (index 1):
First row: indices 2,3 -> 'C', 'G'
Second row: indices 2,3 -> 'C', 'C'
Which matches: Clover, grass, clover, clover

This matches the example, so our implementation is correct.

I understand. The function signature needs to be fixed to match what the tests expect. Since the tests are asking for plants for specific children, the function should probably take a child's name as well. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

kindergarten_garden.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#pragma once

#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

namespace kindergarten_garden {

std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> plants(const std::string& diagram);

#pragma once

#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

namespace kindergarten_garden {

std::vector<std::string> plants(const std::string& diagram, const std::string& child);

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden

```

Now, let's update the implementation to match this new signature:

kindergarten_garden.cpp
```cpp

    std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> result;
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < children.size(); ++i) {
        // For each child, get their plants from both rows
        const size_t index = 2 * i;
        std::vector<std::string> child_plants;

        // Helper lambda to convert char to plant name
        auto char_to_plant = [](char c) -> std::string {
            switch (c) {

    child_plants.push_back(char_to_plant(second_row[start_pos + 1]));
    
    return child_plants;
}

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation now takes a child's name as a second parameter and returns only that child's plants. Let's test it with the provided examples:

1. For Alice (index 0):
   First row: positions 0,1 -> 'V', 'R' -> "violets", "radishes"
   Second row: positions 0,1 -> 'V', 'R' -> "violets", "radishes"
   Result: ["violets", "radishes", "violets", "radishes"]

2. For Bob (index 1):
   First row: positions 2,3 -> 'C', 'G' -> "clover", "grass"
   Second row: positions 2,3 -> 'C', 'C' -> "clover", "clover"
   Result: ["clover", "grass", "clover", "clover"]

This matches the examples given in the instructions.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle the diagram correctly. The diagram may have multiple lines, and we need to split it properly. Let's fix that.

The issue might be with how we're splitting the diagram into rows. The diagram is provided as a single string, which may contain newline characters. Let's split it properly.

Here are the necessary fixes:

This implementation now properly handles splitting the diagram into non-empty lines, which should work even if there are extra newlines or other issues. Let's test this approach:

1. The diagram is split into lines, ignoring any empty lines
2. We ensure we have exactly two rows of plants
3. We find the child's index to determine which cups belong to them
4. We convert the plant codes to their full names

This should now correctly handle cases where the diagram is provided with proper newline separation, and it will work for any valid child name from the list.

I understand. The tests expect an enum type `Plants` to be used, but our implementation returns strings. Let's fix that by using an enum and adjusting our implementation accordingly.

First, let's define the `Plants` enum in the header file:

kindergarten_garden.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#pragma once

#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

namespace kindergarten_garden {

std::vector<std::string> plants(const std::string& diagram, const std::string& child);

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
=======
#pragma once

#include <string>
#include <vector>

namespace kindergarten_garden {

enum class Plants {
    clover,
    grass,
    radishes,
    violets
};

std::vector<Plants> plants(const std::string& diagram, const std::string& child);

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's update the implementation to return `std::vector<Plants>`:

kindergarten_garden.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "kindergarten_garden.h"
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

namespace kindergarten_garden {

std::vector<std::string> plants(const std::string& diagram, const std::string& child) {
    // Split the diagram into rows
    std::vector<std::string> rows;
    std::istringstream iss(diagram);
    std::string line;
    
    while (std::getline(iss, line)) {
        if (!line.empty()) {
            rows.push_back(line);
        }
    }
    
    // Make sure we have exactly two rows
    if (rows.size() != 2) {
        return {};
    }
    
    // List of children in order
    const std::vector<std::string> children = {
        "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David",
        "Eve", "Fred", "Ginny", "Harriet",
        "Ileana", "Joseph", "Kincaid", "Larry"
    };
    
    // Find the index of the child
    auto it = std::find(children.begin(), children.end(), child);
    if (it == children.end()) {
        return {};
    }
    size_t index = std::distance(children.begin(), it);
    
    // Calculate the starting position in each row
    size_t start_pos = 2 * index;
    
    // Get plants from both rows
    std::vector<std::string> child_plants;
    
    // Helper lambda to convert char to plant name
    auto char_to_plant = [](char c) -> std::string {
        switch (c) {
            case 'G': return "grass";
            case 'C': return "clover";
            case 'R': return "radishes";
            case 'V': return "violets";
            default: return "";
        }
    };
    
    // First row plants
    child_plants.push_back(char_to_plant(rows[0][start_pos]));
    child_plants.push_back(char_to_plant(rows[0][start_pos + 1]));
    // Second row plants
    child_plants.push_back(char_to_plant(rows[1][start_pos]));
    child_plants.push_back(char_to_plant(rows[1][start_pos + 1]));
    
    return child_plants;
}

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
=======
#include "kindergarten_garden.h"
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>
#include <algorithm>

namespace kindergarten_garden {

std::vector<Plants> plants(const std::string& diagram, const std::string& child) {

    std::vector<std::string> rows;
    std::istringstream iss(diagram);
    std::string line;
    
    while (std::getline(iss, line)) {
        if (!line.empty()) {
            rows.push_back(line);
        }
    }
    
    // Make sure we have exactly two rows
    if (rows.size() != 2) {
        return {};
    }
    
    // List of children in order

    if (it == children.end()) {
        return {};
    }

    // Calculate the starting position in each row

            case 'C': return Plants::clover;
            case 'R': return Plants::radishes;
            case 'V': return Plants::violets;
            default: return Plants::grass; // Should not happen according to the problem
        }
    };
    
    // First row plants
    child_plants.push_back(char_to_plant(rows[0][start_pos]));
    child_plants.push_back(char_to_plant(rows[0][start_pos + 1]));
    // Second row plants
    child_plants.push_back(char_to_plant(rows[1][start_pos]));
    child_plants.push_back(char_to_plant(rows[1][start_pos + 1]));
    
    return child_plants;
}

}  // namespace kindergarten_garden
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation now uses the `Plants` enum which matches what the tests expect. The function signature and return type have been updated to use `std::vector<Plants>` instead of `std::vector<std::string>`.

The implementation still follows the same logic:
1. Split the diagram into two rows
2. Find the index of the child in the ordered list
3. Get the appropriate plants from both rows based on the child's index
4. Convert the character codes to the corresponding enum values

This should now work with the tests that expect enum values rather than strings. Let's hope this resolves the compilation errors.

I understand. The tests are expecting the enum values to match certain names, and there might be an issue with the order or naming. Let's fix that.

The plant names in the enum should match the expected values from the tests. Since the tests are using names like `radishes` and `violets`, which are plural, our implementation should be correct. However, the error might be in how we're parsing the diagram or indexing the children.

Wait, the children's names are ordered alphabetically, and we need to find the correct index for each child. Let's make sure we're always using the same order.

But the implementation looks correct. Let's try to print some debug information, but since we can't, we need to be precise.

Actually, the issue might be that the child's name needs to be matched case-sensitively, and the tests might be using a specific case. Let's ensure we're using the exact same names.

Wait, the implementation uses "Alice", "Bob", etc., which should be correct. Let's make sure the diagram parsing is correct.

But the tests might be expecting the plants to be in a specific order. The instructions say:
1. The first row is nearest the windows
2. Each child gets two cups from each row
3. The plants should be ordered in the result accordingly

So for Alice, it would be:
First two from first row, then first two from second row

This matches our implementation.

Wait, the implementation uses `std::find` which is case-sensitive, and the child's name passed in must match exactly.

Let's make sure the child names are exactly as specified:
"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve", "Fred", "Ginny", "Harriet", "Ileana", "Joseph", "Kincaid", "Larry"

This seems correct.

Wait, the implementation may have an issue with the number of rows. The diagram may have exactly two lines, and we need to make sure we're parsing them correctly.

Let's fix the implementation to be more robust:

```

This implementation is more precise in splitting the diagram and handling the rows. It ensures that:
1. We always have exactly two rows
2. The rows are non-empty and of equal length
3. The child's index is found correctly
4. We don't access out of bounds positions

This should now handle the diagram parsing correctly and match the plants to the right child. Let's hope this resolves any issues with the tests.
