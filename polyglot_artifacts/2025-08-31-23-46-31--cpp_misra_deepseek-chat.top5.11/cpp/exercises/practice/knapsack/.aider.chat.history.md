#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a fancy store.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value and weight.  
#### Bob would gladly take all of the items, but his knapsack can only hold so much weight.  
#### Bob has to carefully consider which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to determine which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized, taking into account the knapsack's carrying capacity.  
####   
#### Items will be represented as a list of items.  
#### Each item will have a weight and value.  
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10  
#### ```  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.h knapsack.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a function to solve the classic 0/1 knapsack problem, where we want to maximize the total value without exceeding the maximum weight capacity. Since we can only take one of each item, this is a standard dynamic programming problem.

Since the implementation needs to be in C++ and follow the provided guidelines, we'll need to include the appropriate headers and use fixed-width integer types. Let's proceed.

First, we need to add a function declaration to the header file, and then implement it in the cpp file.

Since the items are provided, and the maximum weight is given, we'll need to process them to find the maximum value.

However, the instructions don't specify the function signature, so we need to be careful. Let's assume we need to implement a function that takes a list of items and maximum weight, and returns the maximum value.

Wait, the example shows items being taken, but the instructions say to determine which items to take. But the example only shows the maximum value. Let's focus on the maximum value first.

Wait, the instructions say "determine which items to take", but the example only shows the maximum value. This might be ambiguous. Let's assume we need to return the maximum value, not the items themselves.

Let's implement the maximum value calculation using dynamic programming.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Add the function declaration to knapsack.h
2. Implement the function in knapsack.cpp
3. Follow all the MISRA rules

Here are the planned changes:

knapsack.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    int weight;
    int value;
};

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
=======
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    std::int32_t weight;
    std::int32_t value;
};

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items);

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in knapsack.cpp, we'll use dynamic programming where dp[i][w] represents the maximum value that can be obtained using the first i items with weight limit w.

Since weights can be up to the maximum weight, and number of items can be large, we need to be efficient.
However, the maximum weight can be up to 100,000 which might be too big for a 2D array, so we'll use a 1D array to save space.

Here's the implementation:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"

namespace knapsack
{

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty()) 
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores the maximum value for weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights from maximum_weight down to item.weight
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    std::int32_t max_value = 0;
    for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximum_weight; ++w)
    {
        if (dp[w] > max_value)
        {
            max_value = dp[w];
        }
    }
    
    return max_value;
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation uses dynamic programming to find the maximum value that can be obtained without exceeding the maximum weight. It processes each item and updates the dp array from the maximum weight down to the item's weight to ensure each item is only used once.

However, there are a few things to note:
1. All values are positive, so initializing dp with 0 is appropriate
2. We need to make sure we're using the correct types
3. We need to follow the MISRA rules, which we are by using std::int32_t

This implementation should work for the provided example:
Items: weight 5 value 10, weight 4 value 40, weight 6 value 30, weight 4 value 50
Maximum weight: 10

Processing:
- For item 1 (5, 10): Update weights 10-5
- For item 2 (4, 40): Update weights 10-4
- etc.

The maximum value should be 90, which matches the example.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle cases where the maximum weight might be 0, and to ensure it always works correctly. Let's also make sure to follow all the MISRA rules.

However, the implementation looks correct at first glance, but let's test it with the provided example:
Items: weight 5 value 10, weight 4 value 40, weight 6 value 30, weight 4 value 50
Maximum weight: 10

Wait, the implementation should give 90, which matches the example. But perhaps there are other issues.

Wait, the implementation uses std::int32_t for weights, which may be correct, but let's make sure all types are consistent.

Actually, the implementation seems correct, but let's make sure to handle cases where item weights could be larger than the current weight being considered. The loop condition `w >= item.weight` ensures this.

Wait, the implementation always processes from maximum_weight down to item.weight, which is correct for the 0/1 knapsack problem.

However, to follow the MISRA rules, we need to ensure all expressions are properly parenthesized:
1. The condition in the if statement needs parentheses around the addition
2. All loops and conditions need braces

Let's fix these:

Here are the necessary fixes:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack

    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores the maximum value for weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights from maximum_weight down to item.weight
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    std::int32_t max_value = 0;
    for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximum_weight; ++w)
    {
        if (dp[w] > max_value)
        {
            max_value = dp[w];
        }
    }
    
    return max_value;
}

} // namespace knapsack

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty()) 
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores the maximum value for weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(static_cast<std::size_t>(maximum_weight) + 1, 0);

        {
            if (dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)] < (dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w - item.weight)] + item.value))
            {
                dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)] = dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w - item.weight)] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    std::int32_t max_value = 0;
    for (std::int32_t w = 0; w <= maximum_weight; ++w)
    {

        {
            max_value = dp[static_cast<std::size_t>(w)];
        }
    }
    
    return max_value;
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue: using integers to index into vectors. Since maximum_weight can be up to 100,000, which fits in std::size_t, we need to cast indices to avoid signed/unsigned mismatches.

Wait, the implementation uses std::int32_t for weights, which are used to index into the vector. Since vector indices are of type std::size_t, we need to cast them appropriately.

This implementation now properly casts indices to std::size_t when accessing the dp vector.

Also, all expressions are properly parenthesized according to the rules:
1. The addition in the if condition is parenthesized
2. All if statements have their bodies in braces
3. All loops have their bodies in braces

This should now follow all the MISRA rules while correctly solving the knapsack problem. Let's test it with the provided example:

Processing:
1. Initialize dp to all zeros with size 11
2. For each item, update dp from weight 10 down to the item's weight
3. After processing all items, find the maximum value in dp

For the items:
- (5,10): Update weights 10-5
- (4,40): Update weights 10-4
- (6,30): Update weights 10-6
- (4,50): Update weights 10-4

This should give dp[10] = max(0 + 40 + 50) = 90, which matches the example.

This implementation should work correctly. Let's proceed.
