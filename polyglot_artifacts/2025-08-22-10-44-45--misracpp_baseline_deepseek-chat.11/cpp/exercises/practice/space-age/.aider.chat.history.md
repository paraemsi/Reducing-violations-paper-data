#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

I understand. We need to create a class that can calculate someone's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the age is given in seconds, and each planet's year is defined relative to Earth years, we can first calculate the age in Earth years, and then divide by the orbital period to get the planet-specific age.

First, let's define a class in the header file that can handle these calculations.

Wait, the instructions say not to change existing functions or classes, but the namespace is empty. So we need to add a class within the namespace.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a class `space_age` that takes seconds in its constructor
2. Add methods to get the age on each planet
3. Add a method to get the age in Earth seconds
4. Since Earth year is 31557600 seconds, we can use this to compute Earth years first

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    long long age_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(long long seconds);
    long long seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation in space_age.cpp, we need to implement each of these methods:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_seconds / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return on_earth() / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return on_earth() / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return on_earth() / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to make sure that all calculations are precise. Since we're dealing with floating point numbers, using double precision should be sufficient. The implementation uses the Earth year as a base and divides by each planet's orbital period to get the age on that planet.

This implementation should work according to the instructions:
1. The constructor takes an age in seconds
2. The seconds() method returns the raw seconds
3. Each on_*() method calculates the age on that planet by first converting to Earth years and then adjusting for the planet's orbital period

Wait, the note says that one Earth year equals 31,557,600 seconds, which matches our implementation (31557600.0). This is correct.

This implementation should now be able to handle the example where 1,000,000,000 seconds is approximately 31.69 Earth years:
1,000,000,000 / 31,557,600 ≈ 31.68808781402895 which matches the given value of 31.69 when rounded.

Let's proceed with this implementation.

I understand. The implementation needs to be precise and match the expected interface. Let's make sure all the methods are correctly implemented. The implementation looks correct, but perhaps there are precision issues or the tests expect specific rounding.

Wait, the age in seconds is a long long, which is correct. The calculations use floating point division, which should be precise enough.

However, the implementation seems to be correct. Let's make sure the on_earth() method is public, which it is. But perhaps the tests expect a certain precision.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the issue is that the tests are not passing due to floating point precision. Let's make sure we're using the exact values from the table.

Wait, the implementation uses division by the orbital period, which is correct because:
age on planet = (age in seconds) / (Earth seconds per year) / (orbital period)
Which is the same as (age in Earth years) / (orbital period)

This matches our implementation.

Perhaps the tests expect the age to be rounded to a certain number of decimal places. But the instructions don't specify that.

Wait, the implementation of on_earth() is used by other methods, but it's not declared in the header. Let's check:
The header declares on_earth() on line 14, which matches the implementation.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Maybe the issue is that the tests are not seeing the on_earth() method, but it's declared in the header.

Perhaps the implementation needs to be more precise by using more precise values or a different approach.

Wait, the implementation uses floating point division which can have precision issues. Let's use the exact values from the table and compute directly:
age on planet = seconds / (31557600 * orbital_period)

This might be more precise:
Let's change the implementation to use this approach.

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

    return age_seconds / 31557600.0;
}

    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;

    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_seconds / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 0.2408467);
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 0.61519726);
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 1.8808158);
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 11.862615);
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 29.447498);
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 84.016846);
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return age_seconds / (31557600.0 * 164.79132);
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation directly computes the age on each planet by dividing the number of seconds by the length of a year on that planet in seconds. This avoids potential precision issues from chained divisions.

This should be more precise and match what the tests expect. Let's hope this fixes any issues.
