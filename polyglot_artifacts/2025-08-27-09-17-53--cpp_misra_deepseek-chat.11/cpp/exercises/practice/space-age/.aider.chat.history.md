#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.

#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a class that can calculate someone's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the age is given in seconds, and each planet's year is defined relative to Earth years, we can first calculate the age in Earth years, and then divide by the orbital period to get the planet-specific age.

First, let's define the class structure in the header file, and then implement it in the source file.

Wait, the files are currently empty, so we need to add everything from scratch.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a class to space_age.h that can store the age in seconds
2. Add methods to calculate age on each planet
3. Implement these methods in space_age.cpp

Since the orbital periods are fixed, we can use them as constants.

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    std::int64_t age_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(std::int64_t seconds);
    std::int64_t seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation in space_age.cpp, we need to calculate the Earth age first, and then divide by each planet's orbital period:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(std::int64_t seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

std::int64_t space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    constexpr double earth_seconds_per_year = 31557600.0;
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_seconds_per_year;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return on_earth() / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return on_earth() / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return on_earth() / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a small issue: the age in seconds is an integer, but when we divide, we need to use floating point division to get precise results. This implementation should work correctly.

Wait, the instructions say to use fixed-width integer types, which we've done by using std::int64_t. Also, all operations are using floating point numbers, which is appropriate.

This implementation should be efficient and accurate. Let's test the numbers:
1,000,000,000 seconds should give 31.69 Earth years, which matches the example:
1,000,000,000 / 31,557,600 ≈ 31.688087...

Since we're using floating point division, this should be precise enough.

This implementation follows the instructions and should work correctly. Let's proceed.

I understand. The issue is that we're using `std::int64_t` directly, which violates the MISRA C++ rule about not using standard integer types. We need to use fixed-width types instead. Let's fix that.

Wait, `std::int64_t` is a fixed-width type from `<cstdint>`, which should be fine according to the rules. But the rule says:
"The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used"
But `std::int64_t` is not a standard type name like 'int', 'long', etc. It's a fixed-width type.

Perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let's re-read the rule:
It says to use fixed-width types like `std::int8_t`, `std::int16_t`, etc., which is exactly what we're doing with `std::int64_t`.

Wait, maybe the issue is that we need to use a typedef/using alias? Let's follow that approach to be safe.

Let's create an alias for the integer type and use it consistently.

Here are the necessary fixes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

class space_age {

    std::int64_t seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

using age_seconds_t = std::int64_t;

class space_age {
private:
    age_seconds_t age_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(age_seconds_t seconds);
    age_seconds_t seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;

    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, we need to update the implementation file to use the alias:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(std::int64_t seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

std::int64_t space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    constexpr double earth_seconds_per_year = 31557600.0;
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_seconds_per_year;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return on_earth() / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return on_earth() / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return on_earth() / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(age_seconds_t seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

age_seconds_t space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    constexpr double earth_seconds_per_year = 31557600.0;
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_seconds_per_year;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return on_earth() / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return on_earth() / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return on_earth() / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change uses an alias `age_seconds_t` which is defined as `std::int64_t`, which should satisfy the MISRA C++ rule about not using standard integer types directly. The implementation remains the same, which is correct for the functionality required.

I understand. The issue is that we're using `std::int64_t` directly, which violates the MISRA C++ rule about not using standard integer types. Let's fix this by defining our own fixed-width integer type using the underlying type that `std::int64_t` would use, but without directly using the standard type name.

However, this seems tricky. Let's think about this differently. The rule says to use fixed-width types from `<cstdint>`, which we are doing, but perhaps it wants us to never use them directly, always through an alias. But we're already doing that with `age_seconds_t`.

Wait, the rule says:
"The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used"
This refers to types like 'int', 'long', etc., not `std::int64_t` which are fixed-width types.

But perhaps the issue is that `std::int64_t` might be a typedef to a standard type, which would violate the rule. So we need to make sure we're not using any standard types directly or indirectly.

Let's define our own type that's guaranteed to be 64-bit signed integer. But this is platform-dependent.
Actually, the best approach is to use the fixed-width types through an alias, which we're already doing.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the function signatures need to use the alias consistently, which they do.

Perhaps the issue is that the implementation needs to be adjusted to follow other MISRA rules, like using parentheses appropriately.

Let's check the implementation for any potential issues with operator precedence:
All divisions are straightforward, but let's make sure to add parentheses where necessary.

Wait, all the operations are simple divisions, which have the same precedence, so no parentheses are needed according to the rules.
But to be thorough, let's add them.

Wait, the rules say:
"Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression."
Since we're just doing division, and both operands are simple, it's fine.

Actually, let's make sure all floating point constants are precise by using the appropriate suffixes.
But the numbers are given with enough precision.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Maybe the issue is that we need to include the header in the implementation file, which we are doing.
Or perhaps there's a missing function declaration.

Wait, the provided code shows all the function declarations match between the header and implementation.
Let's make sure all floating point operations are precise by using the right types.

Actually, let's add parentheses to divisions to be extra safe, though it's not necessary:

Wait, the rules say to always parenthesize when operators have different precedence levels.
Division and division have the same precedence, so it's fine.

Perhaps the issue is that we need to use exact values from the table:
The table shows orbital periods, which we're using correctly.

Let's make sure all numbers are used exactly as provided:

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Perhaps the issue is that the tests expect certain precision.
Let's make sure to use the exact values from the instructions.

Here's a revised implementation that's more precise by using the exact values:

Wait, the numbers in the implementation match the table:
Mercury: 0.2408467
Venus: 0.61519726
etc.

Perhaps we need to use constexpr for these values to ensure they're compile-time constants:

Let's update the implementation to use constexpr for the orbital periods:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
double space_age::on_earth() const {
    constexpr double earth_seconds_per_year = 31557600.0;
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_seconds_per_year;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return on_earth() / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return on_earth() / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return on_earth() / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}
=======
double space_age::on_earth() const {
    constexpr double earth_seconds_per_year = 31557600.0;
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds)) / earth_seconds_per_year;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    constexpr double orbital_period = 0.2408467;
    return (on_earth()) / orbital_period;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    constexpr double orbital_period = 0.61519726;
    return (on_earth()) / orbital_period;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    constexpr double orbital_period = 1.8808158;
    return (on_earth()) / orbital_period;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    constexpr double orbital_period = 11.862615;
    return (on_earth()) / orbital_period;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    constexpr double orbital_period = 29.447498;
    return (on_earth()) / orbital_period;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    constexpr double orbital_period = 84.016846;
    return (on_earth()) / orbital_period;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    constexpr double orbital_period = 164.79132;
    return (on_earth()) / orbital_period;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This adds parentheses around the divisions and uses constexpr for the orbital periods, which may help with precision and performance. It also follows the MISRA rule about parenthesizing expressions, though in this case, the parentheses are not strictly necessary since all operators have the same precedence.

This implementation should now satisfy all requirements and follow the MISRA C++ rules provided.
