#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You've just been hired as professor of mathematics.  
#### Your first week went well, but something is off in your second week.  
#### The problem is that every answer given by your students is wrong!  
#### Luckily, your math skills have allowed you to identify the problem: the student answers _are_ correct, but they're all in base 2 (binary)!  
#### Amazingly, it turns out that each week, the students use a different base.  
#### To help you quickly verify the student answers, you'll be building a tool to translate between bases.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Convert a sequence of digits in one base, representing a number, into a sequence of digits in another base, representing the same number.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### Try to implement the conversion yourself.  
#### Do not use something else to perform the conversion for you.

#### ## About [Positional Notation][positional-notation]  
####   
#### In positional notation, a number in base **b** can be understood as a linear combination of powers of **b**.  
####   
#### The number 42, _in base 10_, means:  
####   
#### `(4 × 10¹) + (2 × 10⁰)`  
####   
#### The number 101010, _in base 2_, means:  
####   
#### `(1 × 2⁵) + (0 × 2⁴) + (1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (1 × 2¹) + (0 × 2⁰)`  
####   
#### The number 1120, _in base 3_, means:  
####   
#### `(1 × 3³) + (1 × 3²) + (2 × 3¹) + (0 × 3⁰)`  
####   
#### _Yes. Those three numbers above are exactly the same. Congratulations!_

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: all_your_base.h all_your_base.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a function that converts digits from one base to another. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the function isn't specified, I'll assume it needs to be added to the provided files. Let's add a function that takes:
1. The input base
2. A vector of digits in that base
3. The output base
4. Returns a vector of digits in the output base

However, we need to be careful about:
1. Validating the input (bases must be at least 2, digits must be valid for their base)
2. Handling empty input
3. Converting through an intermediate representation

Since we can't use the standard library to do the conversion directly, we'll need to:
1. Convert the input digits to a number (using the input base)
2. Convert that number to the output base digits

However, the number could be very large, so we need to be careful about overflow. But since the instructions don't specify, we'll assume numbers fit within standard integer types.

Wait, the MISRA rules say to use fixed-width types, so we'll use those.

Let's implement this:

Here's the plan:
1. First, check if the input base is at least 2, and output base is at least 2
2. Check all digits are valid for the input base (each digit must be less than the input base)
3. Convert the digits to a number by summing digit * base^position
4. Convert the number to the output base by repeatedly dividing and taking remainders

However, we need to handle the case where the input digits are empty
According to the problem, it's probably an error, but we need to see what the tests expect

Let's implement:

Here are the necessary changes:

all_your_base.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(ALL_YOUR_BASE_H)
#define ALL_YOUR_BASE_H

namespace all_your_base {

}  // namespace all_your_base

#endif // ALL_YOUR_BASE_H
=======
#if !defined(ALL_YOUR_BASE_H)
#define ALL_YOUR_BASE_H

#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

namespace all_your_base {

std::vector<std::uint32_t> convert(std::uint32_t input_base, 
                                   const std::vector<std::uint32_t>& input_digits, 
                                   std::uint32_t output_base);

}  // namespace all_your_base

#endif // ALL_YOUR_BASE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in all_your_base.cpp:

all_your_base.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "all_your_base.h"

namespace all_your_base {

}  // namespace all_your_base
=======
#include "all_your_base.h"
#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace all_your_base {

std::vector<std::uint32_t> convert(std::uint32_t input_base, 
                                   const std::vector<std::uint32_t>& input_digits, 
                                   std::uint32_t output_base) {
    // Check if bases are valid
    if (input_base < 2) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("input base must be >= 2");
    }
    if (output_base < 2) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("output base must be >= 2");
    }
    
    // Handle empty input
    if (input_digits.empty()) {
        return {};
    }
    
    // Check all digits are valid for the input base
    for (const auto& digit : input_digits) {
        if (digit >= input_base) {
            throw std::invalid_argument("all digits must satisfy 0 <= d < input base");
        }
    }
    
    // Convert to base 10 number first
    std::uint64_t number = 0;
    for (const auto& digit : input_digits) {
        number = (number * input_base) + digit;
    }
    
    // Handle the case when number is 0
    if (number == 0) {
        return {0};
    }
    
    // Convert to output base
    std::vector<std::uint32_t> output_digits;
    while (number > 0) {
        output_digits.insert(output_digits.begin(), number % output_base);
        number /= output_base;
    }
    
    return output_digits;
}

}  // namespace all_your_base
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We're using std::uint64_t to handle potentially large numbers
2. We're checking for invalid bases and digits
3. We're handling the case where the number is zero
4. We're inserting digits at the beginning to maintain order

This implementation should work for most cases. Let's test some examples:
- Convert 42 from base 10 to base 2: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
- Convert 101010 from base 2 to base 10: [4, 2]
- Convert 1120 from base 3 to base 10: [4, 2]

Wait, but according to the note, all these numbers are the same, which matches:
42 in base 10 == 101010 in base 2 == 1120 in base 3

This implementation should correctly handle these conversions. Let's proceed.

I understand. The function signature needs to be fixed to match what the tests expect. Since the tests may be expecting a different signature, we need to be careful. Let's look at the implementation and see if there are any issues.

However, the implementation seems to be correct, but perhaps the function name or parameters are different. Since the user says to fix errors, and the relevant lines are marked, maybe the function signature needs to be different.

Wait, the instructions say "Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc." So perhaps the function name is not 'convert'? Or maybe the parameters are different?

Since the user hasn't provided the exact expected signature, I need to be careful. Let's assume the function name and parameters are correct, and focus on implementation issues.

However, there's one potential issue: when the input digits are all zeros, we need to return a single zero digit. But our implementation handles number == 0, which is correct.

Wait, but if the input digits are [0, 0], which is valid, we should return [0], which matches our implementation.

Another thing: the implementation may throw exceptions, but perhaps the tests expect something else.

Let's fix the implementation to be more robust:

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but perhaps the function signature needs to be different. Since the user marked those lines, maybe the function should be named differently or have different parameters.

But the instructions say not to change existing function names, so perhaps 'convert' is correct.

Let's proceed with the implementation, but make sure to handle edge cases properly:

Here are the fixes:

```

However, this implementation is very similar to before. The main difference is being explicit about returning an empty vector when input is empty, which may be what the tests expect.

Wait, the user says to fix errors, but the implementation seems correct. Perhaps there's an issue with the function signature not matching what the tests expect. Since we can't see the tests, we need to be careful.

Since the user marked the function signature in the header, perhaps the issue is with the parameters. Maybe they should be unsigned integers or something else.

But according to the MISRA rules, we're using std::uint32_t which is appropriate.

Another possibility is that the function should be in a different namespace or have a different name, but the instructions say not to change existing function names.

Perhaps the tests expect to handle cases where all digits are zero differently. Let's always return a single zero if the number is zero, which we do.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Let's run with this and see if it fixes the issues.

I understand the issue. The tests expect that when the input digits represent zero (like [0] or [0, 0]), the output should be an empty vector, not [0]. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

all_your_base.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    // Handle zero case
    if (num == 0) {
        return std::vector<std::uint32_t>{0};

```

This change ensures that when the number is zero, we return an empty vector instead of a vector containing a single zero, which matches what the tests expect.

However, we need to make sure that all digits are valid, including checking for non-negative values:
Wait, since digits are std::uint32_t, they can't be negative, so we don't need to check for that.

This should now pass the tests:
1. "single_zero" test: input is [0], which will make num == 0, so we return {} which matches expected
2. "multiple_zeros" test: input is [0, 0, 0], which will also make num == 0, so we return {} which matches expected

Let's run the tests with this fix.
