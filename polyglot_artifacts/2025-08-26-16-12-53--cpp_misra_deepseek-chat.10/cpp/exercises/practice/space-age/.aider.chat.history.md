#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a class that can calculate someone's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

Since we're working in C++, we'll create a class that can be constructed with an age in seconds, and then provide methods to get the age on each planet.

First, let's define the class interface in the header file, and then implement it in the source file.

Wait, the orbital periods are given in Earth years, so to find the age on a planet, we can divide the Earth age by the orbital period ratio.
Earth age in years is (age in seconds) / 31557600.0

Let's implement this:

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    double age_in_seconds_;
public:
    explicit space_age(double seconds);
    double seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the class in space_age.cpp:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(double seconds) : age_in_seconds_(seconds) {}

double space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_in_seconds_;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_in_seconds_ / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return on_earth() / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return on_earth() / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return on_earth() / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, we need to be careful about floating point precision. Since the tests might expect precise values, we need to make sure our calculations are accurate. Using the exact values provided should be sufficient.

This implementation should work by first calculating the age in Earth years, and then dividing by the orbital period ratio to get the age on other planets. The `seconds()` method just returns the original age in seconds, which is straightforward.

Let's test this approach:
- For 1,000,000,000 seconds, on_earth() should be 1000000000 / 31557600 ≈ 31.69
- Then, on Mercury, it would be 31.69 / 0.2408467 ≈ 131.57

This matches the example provided in the instructions.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to match the interface. The header file declares `on_mercury()` before `on_earth()`, but in the implementation, `on_earth()` is defined before `on_mercury()`. This is fine, but the implementation needs to be in the correct order to match the declarations.

Wait, the order of implementation doesn't matter in C++ as long as the signatures match. But perhaps there's another issue.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Let's make sure all the function signatures match exactly. The implementation seems to be missing `on_earth()` in the header? No, it's there on line 14.

Wait, the error markers are on lines 11 and 12, which are `seconds()` and `on_mercury()`. Maybe there's a mismatch in the implementation?

But looking at the implementation, `seconds()` is implemented correctly, and `on_mercury()` uses `on_earth()`, which is also implemented.

Perhaps the issue is that `on_earth()` needs to be declared before `on_mercury()` in the class definition? Let's reorder them:

Wait, the order in the class definition matters for compilation. Since `on_mercury()` uses `on_earth()`, `on_earth()` needs to be declared before `on_mercury()` in the class definition.

Let's fix the order in the header file:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    double seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
=======
    double seconds() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This way, when `on_mercury()` is compiled, it will know about `on_earth()` which is declared before it.

This should resolve any issues with the order of member function declarations. Let's see if this fixes the problem.

I see. The implementation seems correct, but perhaps there are precision issues or the tests expect a certain number of decimal places. Let's ensure all calculations are precise by using the exact values from the instructions.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the issue is that we need to use more precise calculations or ensure that floating point errors don't occur.

However, the error markers are on lines 11 and 12, which are just declarations. This suggests there might be an issue with how these functions are implemented or used.

Perhaps the tests expect the age to be in a specific format or precision. Let's make sure we're using the exact values from the instructions:

Wait, the Earth year in seconds is 31,557,600 which matches 31557600.0
The orbital periods are also exact matches.

Maybe the issue is that the tests expect the functions to be defined in a certain order, but that shouldn't matter.

Wait, perhaps the tests are checking for very precise values, and our implementation may have floating point inaccuracies. Let's use more precise calculations by using the exact values from the table.

But the implementation seems correct. Let's try to ensure all divisions are done with the exact values:

Wait, maybe the issue is that we need to use the reciprocal of the orbital periods to multiply instead of divide, which could be more precise:
age_in_seconds_ / (31557600.0 * orbital_period)

Let's implement it this way:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_in_seconds_ / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return on_earth() / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return on_earth() / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return on_earth() / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return on_earth() / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return on_earth() / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return on_earth() / 164.79132;
}
=======
double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return age_in_seconds_ / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return age_in_seconds_ / (31557600.0 * 0.2408467);
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return age_in_seconds_ / (31557600.0 * 0.61519726);
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return age_in_seconds_ / (31557600.0 * 1.8808158);
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return age_in_seconds_ / (31557600.0 * 11.862615);
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return age_in_seconds_ / (31557600.0 * 29.447498);
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return age_in_seconds_ / (31557600.0 * 84.016846);
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return age_in_seconds_ / (31557600.0 * 164.79132);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This approach avoids potential floating point errors from multiple divisions and uses a single division operation which might be more precise. Let's see if this helps.

However, this is mathematically equivalent to the previous implementation, so if there were precision issues, they might still persist. But sometimes the order of operations can affect floating point precision.

Wait, the error markers are on the declarations, not the implementations. This suggests the issue might be in how the functions are declared or used elsewhere. But since we can't see the tests, we need to focus on making sure our implementation is correct.

Perhaps the issue is that the tests expect the functions to be `constexpr` or have other attributes, but the instructions don't mention that.

Another possibility is that the tests are checking for very specific return values, and our implementation might have slight floating point differences. To address this, we could round the results to a certain number of decimal places, but the instructions don't specify that.

Wait, the instructions say to use the exact values provided, which we are doing. Let's make sure all numbers are written with the exact precision from the table:

Wait, all numbers are exactly as provided in the instructions.

Perhaps the issue is that the tests are using integer types where floating point is expected, but that seems unlikely.

Since the error is marked on the declarations, and the implementation seems correct, let's make sure the function signatures match exactly between the header and implementation.

Wait, they do match. Let's check if all necessary includes are present. We have `#include <cmath>` which might not be necessary since we're not using any math functions beyond basic arithmetic.

Actually, we can remove that include:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"
#include <cmath>
=======
#include "space_age.h"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This might be causing issues if it's not needed, but it's unlikely.

Since I can't see the actual errors, these are all the potential fixes I can think of. Let's hope one of them resolves the issue.
