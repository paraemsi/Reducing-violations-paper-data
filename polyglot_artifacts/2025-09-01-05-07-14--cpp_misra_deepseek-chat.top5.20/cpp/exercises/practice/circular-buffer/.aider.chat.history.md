#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.  
####   
#### A circular buffer first starts empty and of some predefined length.  
#### For example, this is a 7-element buffer:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Assume that a 1 is written into the middle of the buffer (exact starting location does not matter in a circular buffer):  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][1][ ][ ][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then assume that two more elements are added — 2 & 3 — which get appended after the 1:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][1][2][3][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### If two elements are then removed from the buffer, the oldest values inside the buffer are removed.  
#### The two elements removed, in this case, are 1 & 2, leaving the buffer with just a 3:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][3][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### If the buffer has 7 elements then it is completely full:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [5][6][7][8][9][3][4]  
#### ```  
####   
#### When the buffer is full an error will be raised, alerting the client that further writes are blocked until a slot becomes free.  
####   
#### When the buffer is full, the client can opt to overwrite the oldest data with a forced write.  
#### In this case, two more elements — A & B — are added and they overwrite the 3 & 4:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [5][6][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### 3 & 4 have been replaced by A & B making 5 now the oldest data in the buffer.  
#### Finally, if two elements are removed then what would be returned is 5 & 6 yielding the buffer:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Because there is space available, if the client again uses overwrite to store C & D then the space where 5 & 6 were stored previously will be used not the location of 7 & 8.  
#### 7 is still the oldest element and the buffer is once again full.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [C][D][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: circular_buffer.h circular_buffer.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

I'll analyze this carefully and implement a circular buffer according to the instructions. Let's think through the implementation:

1. We need a buffer with a fixed size
2. We need to track the start and end of valid data
3. We need to handle reading and writing
4. We need to handle overwriting when the buffer is full

Since we're using C++, we'll implement a class template to make it generic.
However, the instructions don't specify if it should be a template, but since the tests may expect specific types, we'll need to see.
But the provided files don't show any existing functions, so we need to define the interface.

Wait, the instructions say "Don't change the names of existing functions or classes", but the files are empty.
This suggests we need to define the interface ourselves.

Let's define a class template for the circular buffer.
Since we need to handle errors, we'll throw exceptions when appropriate.

However, the instructions mention using fixed-width integer types, so we'll use those for indices and sizes.

Here's the plan:
1. Define a class template in the header
2. Implement it in the cpp file (but templates are usually implemented in headers)
3. Since it's a template, we might need to implement it in the header
4. But the instructions say to modify both files, so perhaps the tests expect a non-template implementation

Wait, the instructions don't specify the type, so perhaps it's for integers.
But to be general, let's make it a template.

However, since the files are empty, we need to define everything.
Let's implement a template class.

Wait, the implementation needs to be in the header if it's a template.
But the instructions say to modify both files, which is tricky.
Perhaps the tests expect a specific type, like integers.

Since the instructions aren't clear, I'll implement a non-template version that handles integers.
But to follow the instructions, we need to use fixed-width types.

Let's implement using std::int32_t for the buffer elements.

Here's the implementation:

circular_buffer.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H)
#define CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H

namespace circular_buffer {

}  // namespace circular_buffer

#endif // CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H
=======
#if !defined(CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H)
#define CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <vector>

namespace circular_buffer {

class circular_buffer {
public:
    explicit circular_buffer(std::size_t capacity);
    std::int32_t read();
    void write(std::int32_t data);
    void overwrite(std::int32_t data);
    void clear();
    std::size_t size() const;
    std::size_t capacity() const;
    bool empty() const;
    bool full() const;

private:
    std::vector<std::int32_t> buffer_;
    std::size_t head_;
    std::size_t tail_;
    std::size_t count_;
    std::size_t capacity_;
};

}  // namespace circular_buffer

#endif // CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in the cpp file:

circular_buffer.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "circular_buffer.h"

namespace circular_buffer {

}  // namespace circular_buffer
=======
#include "circular_buffer.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace circular_buffer {

circular_buffer::circular_buffer(std::size_t capacity) 
    : buffer_(capacity), head_(0), tail_(0), count_(0), capacity_(capacity) {
}

std::int32_t circular_buffer::read() {
    if (empty()) {
        throw std::domain_error("Buffer is empty");
    }
    std::int32_t value = buffer_[head_];
    head_ = (head_ + 1) % capacity_;
    count_--;
    return value;
}

void circular_buffer::write(std::int32_t data) {
    if (full()) {
        throw std::domain_error("Buffer is full");
    }
    buffer_[tail_] = data;
    tail_ = (tail_ + 1) % capacity_;
    count_++;
}

void circular_buffer::overwrite(std::int32_t data) {
    if (full()) {
        // Overwrite the oldest element (head)
        read();
    }
    write(data);
}

void circular_buffer::clear() {
    head_ = 0;
    tail_ = 0;
    count_ = 0;
}

std::size_t circular_buffer::size() const {
    return count_;
}

std::size_t circular_buffer::capacity() const {
    return capacity_;
}

bool circular_buffer::empty() const {
    return (count_ == 0);
}

bool circular_buffer::full() const {
    return (count_ == capacity_);
}

}  // namespace circular_buffer
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. The `overwrite` implementation uses `read()` and `write()` which may not be the most efficient, but it's clear
2. We need to ensure all operations are correct
3. We're using `std::size_t` which is appropriate for sizes
4. All integer types are appropriate

This implementation follows the described behavior:
- `write()` throws when the buffer is full
- `overwrite()` overwrites the oldest data when full
- `read()` throws when the buffer is empty
- The buffer uses a fixed size

However, the implementation uses a count to track number of elements, which makes checking empty/full easy.
The head and tail pointers move around using modulo arithmetic to wrap around.

This should work according to the examples:
1. When adding elements, they're appended at the tail
2. When reading, elements are taken from the head
3. When overwriting on a full buffer, the head is advanced first (by reading) before writing

Wait, the implementation of `overwrite` calls `read()` which may throw if empty, but since we check `full()` first, and if it's full, `count_` equals `capacity_` which is >0, so `empty()` is false, so `read()` won't throw.
This is correct.

This implementation should work. Let's proceed.

I understand. The issue is that we're using `std::int32_t` and `std::size_t` which may not be allowed according to the rules. Let's fix this by using fixed-width integer types consistently.

However, `std::size_t` is used for sizes, which is appropriate, but the rules say to use fixed-width types. Let's use `std::uint32_t` for all integer types to be consistent.

Wait, the rules say:
"The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used"
But `std::size_t` is a standard unsigned integer type, so we need to replace it.

Let's use `std::uint32_t` for all indices and sizes.

Here are the necessary changes:

Key changes made:
1. Replaced `std::size_t` with `std::uint32_t` for all sizes and indices
2. Added 'U' suffix to integer literals to make them unsigned
3. Ensured all function signatures use `std::uint32_t` where appropriate
4. Kept `std::int32_t` for the buffer elements since that's likely what the tests expect

This should now comply with the rules:
- No standard signed/unsigned integer types are used directly
- We're using fixed-width types from `<cstdint>`
- All numeric types are consistent in their usage

Note: The implementation uses `std::vector<std::int32_t>` which is fine because the buffer elements are meant to be integers, and we're using a fixed-width type for them.

I understand. The implementation needs to follow the MISRA C++ rules provided. Let's fix any potential issues:

1. The rules say to always use compound statements for if/else bodies
2. We need to ensure proper parentheses in expressions
3. All numeric operations need to be type-consistent

Wait, the implementation already seems to follow most rules:
1. All if statements use compound statements with braces
2. Numeric types are consistent (all unsigned operations)
3. The modulo operation uses parentheses appropriately

However, there's one potential issue: when using the `%` operator, we need to ensure the operands are properly parenthesized if they involve other operations.
But in our case, `(head_ + 1U)` is properly parenthesized, and `capacity_` is a simple variable, so it's fine.

Actually, the implementation looks correct according to the rules. Perhaps the error markers are pointing out that we need to ensure all if/else statements have braces, which they do.

Wait, the rules say:
"The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement"
All our if statements have bodies enclosed in braces, which is correct.

Perhaps the issue is with the implementation of `overwrite` where `read()` and `write(data)` are called without braces?
But they are within the if block which has braces, and each is a single statement which is fine.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the markers are just indicating where changes could be made, not that there are errors.

Since the implementation already follows the rules, no changes are needed. However, to be thorough, let's make sure all expressions are properly parenthesized:

Wait, all expressions seem fine:
1. `(head_ + 1U) % capacity_` - addition is in parentheses which is correct since % has higher precedence than +
2. Comparisons are simple and don't need additional parentheses

This implementation should be correct. If there are specific errors being reported, they must be from other parts not shown here.

I understand the issue. The tests expect a templated implementation, but our implementation is fixed to `std::int32_t`. Let's fix this by making the implementation a template.

Here are the necessary changes:

circular_buffer.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H)
#define CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <vector>

namespace circular_buffer {

class circular_buffer {
public:
    explicit circular_buffer(std::uint32_t capacity);
    std::int32_t read();
    void write(std::int32_t data);
    void overwrite(std::int32_t data);
    void clear();
    std::uint32_t size() const;
    std::uint32_t capacity() const;
    bool empty() const;
    bool full() const;

private:
    std::vector<std::int32_t> buffer_;
    std::uint32_t head_;
    std::uint32_t tail_;
    std::uint32_t count_;
    std::uint32_t capacity_;
};

}  // namespace circular_buffer

#endif // CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H
=======
#if !defined(CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H)
#define CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <vector>

namespace circular_buffer {

template <typename T>
class circular_buffer {
public:
    explicit circular_buffer(std::uint32_t capacity);
    T read();
    void write(const T& data);
    void overwrite(const T& data);
    void clear();
    std::uint32_t size() const;
    std::uint32_t capacity() const;
    bool empty() const;
    bool full() const;

private:
    std::vector<T> buffer_;
    std::uint32_t head_;
    std::uint32_t tail_;
    std::uint32_t count_;
    std::uint32_t capacity_;
};

}  // namespace circular_buffer

#include "circular_buffer.tpp"

#endif // CIRCULAR_BUFFER_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, since templates need to be implemented in header files, we'll create a new file `circular_buffer.tpp` to hold the implementation:

circular_buffer.tpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
#if !defined(CIRCULAR_BUFFER_TPP)
#define CIRCULAR_BUFFER_TPP

#include "circular_buffer.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace circular_buffer {

template <typename T>
circular_buffer<T>::circular_buffer(std::uint32_t capacity) 
    : buffer_(capacity), head_(0U), tail_(0U), count_(0U), capacity_(capacity) {
}

template <typename T>
T circular_buffer<T>::read() {
    if (empty()) { 
        throw std::domain_error("Buffer is empty");
    }
    T value = buffer_[head_];
    head_ = (head_ + 1U) % capacity_;
    count_--;
    return value;
}

template <typename T>
void circular_buffer<T>::write(const T& data) {
    if (full()) { 
        throw std::domain_error("Buffer is full");
    }
    buffer_[tail_] = data;
    tail_ = (tail_ + 1U) % capacity_;
    count_++;
}

template <typename T>
void circular_buffer<T>::overwrite(const T& data) {
    if (full()) { 
        // Overwrite the oldest element (head)
        read();
    }
    write(data);
}

template <typename T>
void circular_buffer<T>::clear() {
    head_ = 0U;
    tail_ = 0U;
    count_ = 0U;
}

template <typename T>
std::uint32_t circular_buffer<T>::size() const {
    return count_;
}

template <typename T>
std::uint32_t circular_buffer<T>::capacity() const {
    return capacity_;
}

template <typename T>
bool circular_buffer<T>::empty() const {
    return (count_ == 0U);
}

template <typename T>
bool circular_buffer<T>::full() const {
    return (count_ == capacity_);
}

}  // namespace circular_buffer

#endif // CIRCULAR_BUFFER_TPP
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Since we're moving the implementation to a template, we need to update the circular_buffer.cpp file to be empty or remove it. But the instructions say to modify the supplied files, so let's make circular_buffer.cpp empty:

circular_buffer.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "circular_buffer.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace circular_buffer {

circular_buffer::circular_buffer(std::uint32_t capacity) 
    : buffer_(capacity), head_(0U), tail_(0U), count_(0U), capacity_(capacity) {
}

std::int32_t circular_buffer::read() {
    if (empty()) { 
        throw std::domain_error("Buffer is empty");
    }
    std::int32_t value = buffer_[head_];
    head_ = (head_ + 1U) % capacity_;
    count_--;
    return value;
}

void circular_buffer::write(std::int32_t data) {
    if (full()) { 
        throw std::domain_error("Buffer is full");
    }
    buffer_[tail_] = data;
    tail_ = (tail_ + 1U) % capacity_;
    count_++;
}

void circular_buffer::overwrite(std::int32_t data) {
    if (full()) { 
        // Overwrite the oldest element (head)
        read();
    }
    write(data);
}

void circular_buffer::clear() {
    head_ = 0U;
    tail_ = 0U;
    count_ = 0U;
}

std::uint32_t circular_buffer::size() const {
    return count_;
}

std::uint32_t circular_buffer::capacity() const {
    return capacity_;
}

bool circular_buffer::empty() const {
    return (count_ == 0U);
}

bool circular_buffer::full() const {
    return (count_ == capacity_);
}

}  // namespace circular_buffer
=======
#include "circular_buffer.h"

namespace circular_buffer {

// Implementation is now in circular_buffer.tpp

}  // namespace circular_buffer
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation should now work with the tests, which expect a templated buffer that can handle different types, including `int` and `std::string`. The key changes are:
1. Made the class a template
2. Moved implementation to a .tpp file included from the header
3. Used `const T&` for write and overwrite to handle different types efficiently
4. Kept the same logic for the circular buffer operations

This should now compile with the tests that use `circular_buffer::circular_buffer<int>` and `circular_buffer::circular_buffer<std::string>`.

I understand. The issue is that the implementation needs to follow the MISRA C++ rules provided earlier. Let's fix the implementation to comply with these rules:

1. Always use compound statements for if/else bodies
2. Use parentheses to indicate precedence of operators
3. Ensure all operations are type-consistent

Here are the necessary fixes:

circular_buffer.tpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH

T circular_buffer<T>::read() {
    if (empty()) { 
        throw std::domain_error("Buffer is empty");

    head_ = (head_ + 1U) % capacity_;
    count_--;
    return value;
}

template <typename T>
void circular_buffer<T>::write(const T& data) {
    if (full()) { 
        throw std::domain_error("Buffer is full");
    }
    buffer_[tail_] = data;
    tail_ = (tail_ + 1U) % capacity_;
    count_++;
}

template <typename T>
void circular_buffer<T>::overwrite(const T& data) {
    if (full()) { 
        // Overwrite the oldest element (head)
        read();
    }
    write(data);
}

    count_ = 0U;
}

std::uint32_t circular_buffer<T>::size() const {
    return count_;
}

template <typename T>
std::uint32_t circular_buffer<T>::capacity() const {
    return capacity_;
}

template <typename T>
bool circular_buffer<T>::empty() const {
    return (count_ == 0U);
}

template <typename T>
bool circular_buffer<T>::full() const {
    return (count_ == capacity_);
}
=======
template <typename T>
T circular_buffer<T>::read() {
    if (empty()) { 
        throw std::domain_error("Buffer is empty");
    }
    T value = buffer_[head_];
    head_ = ((head_ + 1U) % capacity_);
    count_--;
    return value;
}

template <typename T>
void circular_buffer<T>::write(const T& data) {
    if (full()) { 
        throw std::domain_error("Buffer is full");
    }
    buffer_[tail_] = data;
    tail_ = ((tail_ + 1U) % capacity_);
    count_++;
}

template <typename T>
void circular_buffer<T>::overwrite(const T& data) {
    if (full()) { 
        // Overwrite the oldest element (head)
        read();
    } else {
        // Do nothing
    }
    write(data);
}

template <typename T>
void circular_buffer<T>::clear() {
    head_ = 0U;
    tail_ = 0U;
    count_ = 0U;
}

template <typename T>
std::uint32_t circular_buffer<T>::size() const {
    return count_;
}

template <typename T>
std::uint32_t circular_buffer<T>::capacity() const {
    return capacity_;
}

template <typename T>
bool circular_buffer<T>::empty() const {
    return (count_ == 0U);
}

template <typename T>
bool circular_buffer<T>::full() const {
    return (count_ == capacity_);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Key changes made:
1. Added extra parentheses around `(head_ + 1U) % capacity_` and `(tail_ + 1U) % capacity_` to make the precedence explicit
2. Added an empty else block to the if statement in `overwrite` to always use compound statements
3. All other parts already comply with the rules:
   - All if statements use compound statements with braces
   - Numeric types are consistent (all std::uint32_t)
   - No mixed-type operations

This implementation should now follow the MISRA C++ rules while maintaining the same functionality. The changes are minimal and focused on ensuring proper operator precedence and always using compound statements for control flow.
