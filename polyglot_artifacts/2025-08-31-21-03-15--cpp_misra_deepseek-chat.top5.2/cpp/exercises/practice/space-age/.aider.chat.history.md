#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: space_age.cpp space_age.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a class that can calculate a person's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

Since the age is given in seconds, and each planet's year is relative to Earth years, we can first calculate the age in Earth years, then divide by the orbital period to get the planet-specific age.

First, let's define the class structure in the header file, and then implement it in the source file.

Wait, the instructions say not to change existing function or class names, but the namespace is empty. So we need to add a class or functions to the namespace.

Since this is C++, it's probably best to create a class that holds the age in seconds and provides member functions to get the age on each planet.

Here's the plan:
1. Add a class `space_age` to the namespace
2. The constructor should take an age in seconds
3. Add member functions for each planet to calculate the age
4. The Earth year in seconds is 31557600
5. For other planets, divide the Earth years by their orbital period

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    std::int64_t age_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(std::int64_t seconds);
    std::int64_t seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in space_age.cpp:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"
#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(std::int64_t seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

std::int64_t space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / 31557600.0) / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all floating point operations are precise. Since the age in seconds can be a large integer, we need to cast it to a double to prevent integer division issues.

This implementation should work:
1. The constructor stores the age in seconds
2. The seconds() method returns the raw age in seconds
3. Each planet's age is calculated by first converting to Earth years, then dividing by the orbital period
4. We use floating point division to maintain precision

This implementation follows the instructions and should handle the calculations correctly. Let's test the example:
1,000,000,000 seconds should be 31.69 Earth years, which matches:
1,000,000,000 / 31,557,600 ≈ 31.688

Wait, the note says 31,557,600 seconds per Earth year, which matches our implementation.

I understand. The issue is with the use of `std::int64_t` which violates the MISRA C++ rules provided. We need to use a fixed-width type alias instead. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Create a type alias for the integer type
2. Use the alias consistently
3. Make sure to include <cstdint>

```

These changes ensure that:
1. We're not using the standard integer type directly, but through an alias `age_seconds_t`
2. The alias is defined as `std::int64_t`, which is appropriate for storing age in seconds (which can be a large number)
3. All function signatures use the alias instead of the raw type
4. The implementation remains the same, which correctly calculates the ages on different planets

This should now comply with the MISRA C++ rules provided. Let me know if there are any further issues.

I understand. The issue is that we're using `std::int64_t` directly in the type alias, which violates the MISRA C++ rule about not using standard integer types. Let's fix this by using a fixed-width type from <cstdint> but making sure it's not directly exposed.

Wait, but `std::int64_t` is a fixed-width type from <cstdint>, which should be allowed according to the rules:
"include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, etc."

But the rule says "The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used", which refers to types like 'int', 'long', etc., not the fixed-width types from <cstdint>.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that we need to use the fixed-width types directly without aliasing them? Or maybe the rule is being misinterpreted.

Actually, the rule says to use fixed-width types from <cstdint>, which is what we're doing. But perhaps the issue is that the type alias is using a standard integer type name? Let's read carefully.

The rule says: "The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used"
This refers to types like 'int', 'unsigned long', etc., not 'std::int64_t' which is a fixed-width type.

Wait, but the error is pointing to the line where we use 'std::int64_t' in the alias. Maybe the rule wants us to always use fixed-width types directly without aliasing them? Or perhaps the alias name should be different.

Actually, the rule says: "create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)"
Which is exactly what we're doing.

Perhaps the issue is that the function return type 'age_seconds_t' is being flagged, but that's our alias, which should be fine.

Wait, maybe the issue is that we need to ensure all operations follow the other rules, like using parentheses appropriately and compound statements for if/else.

But looking at the implementation, there are no if statements, and all operations are simple divisions. Let's add parentheses to ensure operator precedence is clear.

Wait, the divisions are all left-associative, so a/b/c is the same as (a/b)/c, which is what we want. But to follow the rule about parentheses, we should add them.

Let's add parentheses to make the order of operations explicit:

Wait, these are the same. Maybe the issue is elsewhere. Perhaps the rule is that we need to use the fixed-width types directly without aliasing them? Let's try removing the alias and using std::int64_t directly:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

using age_seconds_t = std::int64_t;

class space_age {
private:
    age_seconds_t age_seconds;
public:
    explicit space_age(age_seconds_t seconds);
    age_seconds_t seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

class space_age {

    std::int64_t seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"
#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(age_seconds_t seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

    return age_seconds;
}
=======
#include "space_age.h"

space_age::space_age(std::int64_t seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

std::int64_t space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change uses std::int64_t directly, which is a fixed-width type from <cstdint>, and should comply with the rules. The rules say to use fixed-width types, which is what we're doing here. Let's see if this resolves the issue.

I understand. The issue is that we're using `std::int64_t` directly, which violates the MISRA C++ rule about not using standard integer types. Let's create a type alias for a fixed-width integer type and use that instead.

Here are the necessary changes:

space_age.h

    std::int64_t seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

This change creates a type alias `age_seconds_int_t` for `std::int64_t`, and uses this alias throughout the code. This should comply with the MISRA C++ rule which says:
"create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)"

Now, we're not directly using `std::int64_t` in the class interface, which should resolve the issue. The fixed-width type is only used inside the alias definition, and the alias is used everywhere else.
