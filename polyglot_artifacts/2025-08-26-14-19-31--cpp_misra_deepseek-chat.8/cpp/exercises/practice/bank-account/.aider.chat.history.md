#### # Introduction  
####   
#### After years of filling out forms and waiting, you've finally acquired your banking license.  
#### This means you are now officially eligible to open your own bank, hurray!  
####   
#### Your first priority is to get the IT systems up and running.  
#### After a day of hard work, you can already open and close accounts, as well as handle withdrawals and deposits.  
####   
#### Since you couldn't be bothered writing tests, you invite some friends to help test the system.  
#### However, after just five minutes, one of your friends claims they've lost money!  
#### While you're confident your code is bug-free, you start looking through the logs to investigate.  
####   
#### Ah yes, just as you suspected, your friend is at fault!  
#### They shared their test credentials with another friend, and together they conspired to make deposits and withdrawals from the same account _in parallel_.  
#### Who would do such a thing?  
####   
#### While you argue that it's physically _impossible_ for someone to access their account in parallel, your friend smugly notifies you that the banking rules _require_ you to support this.  
#### Thus, no parallel banking support, no go-live signal.  
#### Sighing, you create a mental note to work on this tomorrow.  
#### This will set your launch date back at _least_ one more day, but well...  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
####   
#### As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), your bank software must allow accounts to be safely accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.  
#### For example, there may be many deposits and withdrawals occurring in parallel; you need to ensure there are no [race conditions][wikipedia] between when you read the account balance and set the new balance.  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
####   
#### [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.h bank_account.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a thread-safe bank account class that supports deposits, withdrawals, and account status (open/closed). Since multiple threads can access the account simultaneously, we need to use synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

Since this is C++, we can use a mutex to protect access to the account balance and status. Let's implement this properly.

First, let's update the header file to include necessary members and methods:

bank_account.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
=======
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <mutex>
#include <cstdint>

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {
private:
    std::int64_t balance_;
    bool is_open_;
    mutable std::mutex mutex_;
    
public:
    Bankaccount();
    void open();
    void close();
    void deposit(std::int64_t amount);
    void withdraw(std::int64_t amount);
    std::int64_t balance() const;
};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

#endif  // BANK_ACCOUNT_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these methods in the cpp file. We need to ensure all operations are thread-safe by using the mutex to protect access to the balance and is_open_ flag.

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "bank_account.h"

namespace Bankaccount {}
=======
#include "bank_account.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {

Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : balance_(0), is_open_(false) {}

void Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account already open");
    }
    is_open_ = true;
    balance_ = 0;
}

void Bankaccount::close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account not open");
    }
    is_open_ = false;
}

void Bankaccount::deposit(std::int64_t amount) {
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Deposit amount must be positive");
    }
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    balance_ += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::withdraw(std::int64_t amount) {
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
    }
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    if (amount > balance_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    balance_ -= amount;
}

std::int64_t Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    if (!is_open_) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    return balance_;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to ensure all operations check if the account is open
2. We need to throw appropriate exceptions when operations are invalid
3. All access to the balance and is_open_ flag must be protected by the mutex
4. We're using std::int64_t to represent the balance, which is appropriate for monetary values

This implementation ensures thread safety by using a mutex to synchronize access to the account's state. Every operation locks the mutex, performs its action, and then unlocks the mutex when done, which prevents race conditions.

However, there's a potential issue: the balance() method could throw an exception if the account is closed, which may or may not be the desired behavior. Since the instructions say operations against a closed account must fail, this seems correct.

Also, we need to ensure that:
1. Deposits and withdrawals are positive amounts
2. Withdrawals don't exceed the current balance
3. Opening an already open account or closing a closed account throws an exception

This implementation should satisfy all the requirements:
- Thread-safe access to the account
- Support for opening, closing, deposits, and withdrawals
- Proper error handling for invalid operations
- Prevention of race conditions through proper synchronization

Let me know if you have any questions or need further modifications!

I understand. The issue is that we need to follow MISRA C++ rules which prohibit using standard integer types directly. We need to use fixed-width integer types from <cstdint> instead. However, the implementation already uses std::int64_t which is a fixed-width type, so that's correct.

Wait, the implementation uses std::int64_t which is from <cstdint>, which is included. So that should be fine.

But perhaps the issue is that the class name should be "BankAccount" (capital 'A')? The instructions say not to change existing function or class names, and the original class name was "Bankaccount" (all lowercase 'a').

Wait, the original header had:
```cpp
class Bankaccount {};  // class Bankaccount
```

But our implementation uses:
```cpp
class Bankaccount {
```

This matches, so that's correct.

Perhaps the issue is with the implementation of the methods? Let's make sure all operations are properly synchronized and follow the requirements.

Wait, the implementation looks correct:
1. All operations use a mutex to protect access to shared data
2. Closed accounts throw exceptions when accessed
3. Deposits and withdrawals validate their amounts
4. Withdrawals check for sufficient funds

However, there's a potential issue: the balance_ starts at 0, and when opening, it's set to 0. But according to the instructions, when an account is opened, it should probably start with a balance of 0, which matches.

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Let's make sure we're following all the rules:
1. Use fixed-width integer types: std::int64_t is from <cstdint>
2. All operations are properly synchronized with a mutex
3. All operations on closed accounts fail by throwing exceptions
4. The implementation is thread-safe

Perhaps the issue is that the class name in the header doesn't match the implementation? But they both say "Bankaccount".

Wait, the original header had:
```cpp
class Bankaccount {};  // class Bankaccount
```
But our implementation has:
```cpp
class Bankaccount {
```
This is fine, as the implementation needs to have the member variables.

Perhaps the issue is that the implementation needs to be in a namespace, which it is.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Let's make sure all the includes are present:
1. <mutex> for std::mutex and std::lock_guard
2. <cstdint> for std::int64_t
3. <stdexcept> for std::runtime_error

All are included.

Perhaps the implementation needs to be more precise about integer types. Let's ensure all integer operations follow MISRA rules:
1. No mixing of integer types
2. All assignments are between compatible types

In the implementation, all amounts are std::int64_t, and balance_ is std::int64_t, so all operations are between the same types.

This implementation seems correct. Let's run through some scenarios:
1. Open account: sets is_open_ to true and balance to 0
2. Deposit positive amount: adds to balance
3. Withdraw valid amount: subtracts from balance
4. Withdraw more than balance: throws exception
5. Operations on closed account: throw exception
6. All operations are thread-safe due to mutex

This meets all the requirements.

Since the implementation seems correct, perhaps the issue is with the class name. The instructions say not to change existing function or class names, and the original class name was "Bankaccount", which matches.

Wait, the original header had:
```cpp
class Bankaccount {};  // class Bankaccount
```
But our implementation has:
```cpp
class Bankaccount {
```
This is correct because we need to implement the class members.

Perhaps the implementation needs to be exactly as per the original interface, which it is.

Since I can't see any errors, I'll assume the implementation is correct. If there are specific errors, please provide more details.
