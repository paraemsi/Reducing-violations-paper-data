#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a fancy store.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value and weight.  
#### Bob would gladly take all of the items, but his knapsack can only hold so much weight.  
#### Bob has to carefully consider which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to determine which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized, taking into account the knapsack's carrying capacity.  
####   
#### Items will be represented as a list of items.  
#### Each item will have a weight and value.  
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10  
#### ```  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.cpp knapsack.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a function to solve the classic 0/1 knapsack problem, where we want to maximize the total value without exceeding the maximum weight capacity. Since we can only take one of each item, this is a standard dynamic programming problem.

Since the implementation needs to be efficient, we'll use a dynamic programming approach. However, the implementation needs to be careful about the constraints:
- All values are positive
- We need to find the maximum value, and potentially which items to take

However, the instructions don't specify whether to return the maximum value or the items themselves. Since the example shows which items to take, we need to be precise. But the function signatures aren't provided, so we need to add them.

Let's add a function to the knapsack namespace that takes a list of items and maximum weight, and returns the maximum value. Since the example shows which items to take, we might need to return the selected items, but the instructions aren't clear. Let's assume we need to return the maximum value.

Wait, the example says "determine which items to take", which suggests we need to return the items. But the instructions may be interpreted differently. Let's implement both:
1. A function to get maximum value
2. A function to get the actual items

But since the files are empty, we need to define the interface.

Let's add a function to solve the knapsack problem:
1. First, we'll add the necessary includes
2. Then implement the solution

Since we need to use fixed-width types, we'll include <cstdint> and use appropriate types.

Here's the plan:
1. Add function declarations to knapsack.h
2. Implement them in knapsack.cpp
3. Use dynamic programming approach

Here are the necessary changes:

knapsack.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    int weight;
    int value;
};

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
=======
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    std::int32_t weight;
    std::int32_t value;
};

std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items);

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in knapsack.cpp, we'll use dynamic programming where dp[i][w] represents the maximum value that can be obtained using the first i items with weight limit w.
Since weights can be up to maximumWeight, which can be large, we need to be efficient.

However, the implementation needs to be efficient. Let's use a 1D array to save space.

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"

namespace knapsack
{

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty())
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores the maximum value for weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximumWeight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    // Since all values are non-negative, the maximum will be at the end
    // But to be safe, we can find the maximum element
    return *std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, the example provided:
Items: [
  { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },
  { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }
]
Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10

With our implementation:
- Take second item (weight 4, value 40): dp[4] = 40
- Take fourth item (weight 4, value 50): when processing, for w=8, dp[8] = dp[8-4] + 50 = dp[4] + 50 = 40 + 50 = 90
Which matches the example.

This implementation should work correctly. Let's proceed.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle cases where maximumWeight is 0 or items have weight 0. Also, we need to ensure that we always find the maximum value correctly.

However, the implementation looks mostly correct. Let's test it with some edge cases:
1. maximumWeight = 0: should always return 0
2. Items with weight 0: they can always be taken, adding their value
3. Items with weight greater than maximumWeight: they should be ignored

Wait, in the current implementation, items with weight greater than maximumWeight are handled by the loop condition (w >= item.weight), which is correct.

But for items with weight 0, the loop condition (w >= 0) will always be true, which is also correct.

However, the implementation needs to be efficient and correct. Let's fix it:

Wait, the implementation needs to always find the maximum value, which may not always be at the end of the dp array if there are items with weight 0 that have high value.
But we're using std::max_element which is correct.

However, there's a potential issue when maximumWeight is 0:
- The dp vector will have size 1 (index 0)
- All items with weight > 0 will be skipped
- Items with weight 0 will try to access dp[w - 0] which is dp[w], which is fine
- But since w starts at maximumWeight which is 0, and item.weight must be <= 0
- So only items with weight exactly 0 will be processed

This seems correct.

Let's implement the fix:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty())
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores the maximum value for weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximumWeight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w)
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value))
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    // Since all values are non-negative, the maximum will be at the end
    // But to be safe, we can find the maximum element
    return *std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximumValue(std::int32_t maximumWeight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    // Handle case when maximumWeight is 0
    if (maximumWeight < 0)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Initialize DP array
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximumWeight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // Process from the end to the beginning to avoid reusing items
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= 0; --w)
        {
            // Check if we can include the current item
            if (item.weight <= w)
            {
                // Update the maximum value for weight w
                if ((dp[w - item.weight] + item.value) > dp[w])
                {
                    dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The maximum value will be at dp[maximumWeight]
    // But to be precise, we can find the maximum in the entire dp array
    // However, since all values are non-negative, and we can always not take items to have weight 0,
    // the maximum value will be at the maximum weight we can carry
    // But to handle items with weight 0 that have value, we need to find the maximum in the entire array
    return *std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, this implementation is less efficient because it always processes all weights, even when item.weight is greater than the current weight. Let's optimize it:

Wait, the condition can be adjusted to only process relevant weights:
But to ensure correctness, we need to be careful.

Actually, the previous implementation was more efficient:
for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w)

This ensures we only process weights where the item can fit.
Let's revert to that approach, but make sure to handle cases where item.weight is 0:

Wait, if item.weight is 0, then w >= 0 is always true, which is correct.
So we can use:
for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= (item.weight > 0 ? item.weight : 0); --w)

But to make it more readable, let's use:

Wait, here's a fixed implementation:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // Process from the end to the beginning to avoid reusing items
        for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= 0; --w)
        {
            // Check if we can include the current item
            if (item.weight <= w)
            {
                // Update the maximum value for weight w
                if ((dp[w - item.weight] + item.value) > dp[w])
                {
                    dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
                }
            }
        }
    }
=======
    for (const auto& item : items)
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
        // Start from maximum weight down to the item's weight
        // If item.weight is 0, we need to process all weights
        if (item.weight == 0)
        {
            // Add the value to all dp entries
            for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= 0; --w)
            {
                dp[w] += item.value;
            }
        }
        else
        {
            for (std::int32_t w = maximumWeight; w >= item.weight; --w)
            {
                if ((dp[w - item.weight] + item.value) > dp[w])
                {
                    dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
                }
            }
        }
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation handles items with weight 0 by adding their value to all dp entries, which is correct because we can always take them without affecting the weight.
For other items, we process them normally.

This should now handle all cases correctly:
1. maximumWeight = 0: dp[0] will be the sum of values of all items with weight 0
2. Items with weight greater than maximumWeight: they are ignored by the loop condition
3. Regular items: processed to find maximum value

This implementation should now be correct and efficient. Let's proceed.

I understand. The tests are expecting a function named `maximum_value`, but our implementation uses `maximumValue`. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

This change simply renames the function from `maximumValue` to `maximum_value` to match what the tests expect. The implementation remains the same, which should correctly solve the knapsack problem by finding the maximum value that can be obtained without exceeding the weight limit.

The implementation looks correct, but there might be an issue with handling items that have weight 0. Let's test our approach:
- If an item has weight 0, we add its value to every dp entry
- This means we're always taking it, which is correct
- But if there are multiple items with weight 0, their values should be summed

Wait, the implementation adds the value to all dp entries for each weight 0 item, which is correct
But the implementation seems to be correct

However, the implementation might be inefficient for large maximumWeight values when there are many items with weight 0, but that's probably fine

Wait, the implementation looks correct, but let's make sure to always find the maximum value correctly
Since all values are positive, and items with weight 0 always contribute, we can handle them separately

Actually, let's precompute the sum of values for items with weight 0, and then add that to every dp value at the end
This will be more efficient

Wait, but during processing, when we add items with weight > 0, we need to include the sum of weight 0 items
So we can add the sum to every dp entry first, and then process other items

Here's a revised approach:

        return 0;
    }

    // But to be safe, we can find the maximum element

```

This implementation is more efficient and handles items with weight 0 correctly by adding their total value to every dp entry upfront. Then, it processes items with weight greater than 0 using the standard knapsack approach.

This should now work correctly for all cases:
1. Items with weight 0 always contribute to the total value
2. Items with weight greater than 0 are processed to maximize value without exceeding the weight limit
3. The maximum value is always found correctly

This implementation should now pass the tests. Let's hope this fixes any issues.
