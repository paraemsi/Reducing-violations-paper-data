#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of [perfect](#perfect), [abundant](#abundant), or [deficient](#deficient) based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The _aliquot sum_ is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of `15` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.  
####   
#### ## Perfect  
####   
#### A number is perfect when it equals its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `6` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`  
#### - `28` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`  
####   
#### ## Abundant  
####   
#### A number is abundant when it is less than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `12` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
#### - `24` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36`  
####   
#### ## Deficient  
####   
#### A number is deficient when it is greater than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `8` is a deficient number because `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`  
#### - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is [perfect](#perfect).  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is [abundant](#abundant) or [deficient](#deficient).

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: perfect_numbers.h perfect_numbers.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####

I understand. Let's implement a function to classify numbers as perfect, abundant, or deficient based on their aliquot sum. Since the implementation needs to be in C++, we'll need to add a function to the namespace in both the header and implementation files.

First, we need to include the necessary headers and define the classification types. Let's use an enumeration to represent the classification.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Add an enum class to the header to represent the number classification
2. Implement a function to classify a number
3. Calculate the aliquot sum by summing all proper divisors
4. Compare the aliquot sum to the original number to determine the classification

Wait, the instructions say to determine if a number is perfect, but also mention that depending on the track, we may need to implement abundant and deficient classifications. Let's implement all three to be safe.

Here are the planned changes:

perfect_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(PERFECT_NUMBERS_H)
#define PERFECT_NUMBERS_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace perfect_numbers {

enum class classification {
    perfect,
    abundant,
    deficient
};

classification classify(std::int64_t number);

}  // namespace perfect_numbers

#endif  // PERFECT_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, for the implementation in perfect_numbers.cpp, we need to include the header and implement the classify function:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"

namespace perfect_numbers {}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Classification is only for positive integers");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case (its only proper divisor is 0)
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to include <stdexcept> for std::domain_error
2. We need to include <cmath> for std::sqrt
3. We need to handle edge cases like 1 which has no proper divisors other than 0
4. We need to ensure we're only summing proper divisors (excluding the number itself)
5. We need to make sure to follow the MISRA rules, which we are doing by using std::int64_t

Wait, the aliquot sum is the sum of all proper divisors, which are all divisors except the number itself. So we're correct in not including the number itself in the sum.

This implementation should work efficiently by only checking up to the square root of the number, and adding both divisors when we find a factor. Let's test it with the provided examples:
- 6: divisors are 1, 2, 3 → sum=6 → perfect
- 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 → sum=28 → perfect
- 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 → sum=16 → abundant
- 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 → sum=36 → abundant
- 8: 1, 2, 4 → sum=7 → deficient
- Prime numbers: only divisor is 1 → sum=1 → deficient

This matches the examples. Let's proceed.

I notice that the implementation may have an issue with the handling of the number 1. The comment says "its only proper divisor is 0", but that's not accurate. The proper divisors of 1 are none, so the aliquot sum should be 0, which is less than 1, making it deficient. So the implementation is correct, but the comment is misleading.

However, there's a more efficient way to handle this. Let's fix the comment and ensure the implementation follows best practices.

Wait, the implementation uses floating point numbers (std::sqrt) which may not be ideal for integer operations. Also, we need to ensure we follow the MISRA rules, which may have issues with mixing integer and floating point types.

Let's fix this by using integer-only operations. We can loop up to number/2, but that's less efficient. Or we can use a better approach that's still integer-based.

Actually, to avoid floating point operations, we can use i*i <= number as the loop condition.

Here are the necessary fixes:

perfect_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Classification is only for positive integers");
    }
    
    // Handle 1 as a special case (its only proper divisor is 0)
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1; // 1 is always a proper divisor
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; i <= static_cast<std::int64_t>(std::sqrt(number)); ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
=======
#include "perfect_numbers.h"
#include <stdexcept>

namespace perfect_numbers {

classification classify(std::int64_t number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Classification is only for positive integers");
    }
    
    if (number == 1) {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
    
    std::int64_t sum = 1;
    for (std::int64_t i = 2; (i * i) <= number; ++i) {
        if ((number % i) == 0) {
            sum += i;
            std::int64_t other_divisor = number / i;
            if (other_divisor != i) {
                sum += other_divisor;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == number) {
        return classification::perfect;
    } else if (sum > number) {
        return classification::abundant;
    } else {
        return classification::deficient;
    }
}

}  // namespace perfect_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation now uses integer-only operations, which is better and follows good practices. Let's test it with our examples:
- For number=6: i goes up to 2 (2*2=4 <=6), 3*3=9>6
  i=2: 6%2==0 → sum +=2, other_divisor=3 → sum +=3 → sum=1+2+3=6
  Which matches
- For number=28: i goes up to 5 (5*5=25<=28), 6*6=36>28
  i=2: 28%2==0 → sum +=2, other_divisor=14 → sum +=14 → sum=1+2+14=17
  i=4: 28%4==0 → sum +=4, other_divisor=7 → sum +=7 → sum=17+4+7=28
  Which matches

This implementation should work correctly and efficiently. Let's also make sure to follow the MISRA rules:
1. We're using std::int64_t consistently
2. No mixing of integer and floating point types
3. All operations are integer-based
4. Parentheses are used appropriately in expressions

This implementation should now be ready.
