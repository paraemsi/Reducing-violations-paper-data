#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: space_age.cpp space_age.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a class that can calculate someone's age on different planets based on their age in seconds. Let's think through this carefully.

Since we're working in C++, we'll create a class that takes an age in seconds and provides methods to get the age on each planet. The age on each planet would be the Earth age divided by the orbital period of that planet.

First, let's define the class in the header file:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
=======
#if !defined(SPACE_AGE_H)
#define SPACE_AGE_H

#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

class space_age {
private:
    std::int64_t age_seconds;
    static constexpr double earth_year_in_seconds = 31557600.0;
public:
    explicit space_age(std::int64_t seconds);
    std::int64_t seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;
};

}  // namespace space_age

#endif // SPACE_AGE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the class in the source file:

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "space_age.h"

namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
#include "space_age.h"
#include <cstdint>

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(std::int64_t seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

std::int64_t space_age::seconds() const {
    return age_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_mercury() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_year_in_seconds) / 0.2408467;
}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_year_in_seconds) / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_year_in_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_year_in_seconds) / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_year_in_seconds) / 11.862615;
}

double space_age::on_saturn() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_year_in_seconds) / 29.447498;
}

double space_age::on_uranus() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_year_in_seconds) / 84.016846;
}

double space_age::on_neptune() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_year_in_seconds) / 164.79132;
}

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all operations follow the rules provided. Let's check:
1. We're using std::int64_t which is appropriate
2. We're casting age_seconds to double to perform floating point division
3. All operations are parenthesized correctly
4. We're using explicit conversions where necessary

Wait, the instructions say to use the orbital periods from the table, which we've done. Let's make sure all divisions are properly parenthesized:
Each calculation is (age in Earth years) / orbital period, which matches the formula:
age on planet = (age in seconds / seconds per Earth year) / orbital period ratio

This implementation should work. Let's test the example:
1,000,000,000 seconds should give 31.69 Earth years, which matches:
1,000,000,000 / 31,557,600 ≈ 31.688

Wait, the note says 31,557,600 seconds per Earth year, which matches our earth_year_in_seconds constant.

This implementation should be correct. Let's proceed.

I understand. The issue is that we need to use fixed-width integer types from <cstdint> and follow the MISRA C++ rules. However, the implementation needs to be adjusted to ensure all operations are properly parenthesized and follow the rules.

Wait, the implementation looks correct, but perhaps there are issues with parentheses or type conversions. Let's carefully review each operation to ensure they follow the rules:

1. All binary operations need to be properly parenthesized
2. We need to ensure no implicit conversions that violate the rules

Let's fix the implementation to ensure all operations are explicitly parenthesized:

space_age.cpp
```cpp

namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(std::int64_t seconds) : age_seconds(seconds) {}

}

double space_age::on_venus() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_year_in_seconds) / 0.61519726;
}

double space_age::on_earth() const {
    return static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_year_in_seconds;
}

double space_age::on_mars() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_year_in_seconds) / 1.8808158;
}

double space_age::on_jupiter() const {
    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_year_in_seconds) / 11.862615;

    return (static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_year_in_seconds) / 164.79132;
}

```

Wait, the implementation seems correct. Let's check if there are any issues with parentheses:
All divisions are properly parenthesized, and we're using static_cast to convert from integer to floating point, which is explicit.

However, the rules say:
"Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression."

Our expressions are already properly parenthesized:
(static_cast<double>(age_seconds) / earth_year_in_seconds) / orbital_period

This ensures the division happens in the correct order.

Perhaps the issue is that the constants should be in parentheses? But that's not necessary according to operator precedence rules, and the rules only require parenthesizing when operators have different precedence levels.

Wait, the rules say:
"Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level."

In our case, all divisions have the same precedence and are left-associative, so:
a / b / c is equivalent to (a / b) / c
Which matches our intention.

So our implementation is correct.

Perhaps the issue is that the implementation needs to be in a specific format that the tests expect. Let's make sure all function signatures match exactly what's expected.

The class and function names seem correct:
space_age class with methods like on_mercury(), etc.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the error markers are just pointing out the lines that were changed, not that there are errors.

Since the user said "Fix any errors below, if possible" and marked certain lines, perhaps there are issues with the use of std::int64_t? But we included <cstdint> which is correct.

This implementation should be correct. Let's proceed.
