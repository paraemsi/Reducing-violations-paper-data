#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.  
####   
#### `a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.  
#### The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.  
#### The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.  
####   
#### The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:  
#### `(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,  
#### `(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.  
####   
#### Multiplication result is by definition  
#### `(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.  
####   
#### The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is  
#### `1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:  
#### `(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Raising e to a complex exponent can be expressed as `e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`, the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,  
#### - conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.  
####   
#### Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: complex_numbers.h complex_numbers.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I'll implement a complex number class with the required operations. Let's start by defining the class structure in the header file and then implement the methods in the source file.

Since we need to use floating point numbers, we'll use `double` for the real and imaginary parts. However, according to the rules, we need to be careful about types. Since the instructions don't specify precision, we'll use `double` which is standard.

First, let's define the Complex class in the header:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
    
    // Operators
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement all the methods in the source file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "complex_numbers.h"

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
#include "complex_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

Complex::Complex(double real, double imag) : real_(real), imag_(imag) {}

double Complex::real() const {
    return real_;
}

double Complex::imag() const {
    return imag_;
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}

Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_, -imag_);
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex(magnitude * std::cos(imag_), magnitude * std::sin(imag_));
}

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_ + other.real_, imag_ + other.imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_ - other.real_, imag_ - other.imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all operations follow the MISRA C++ rules:
1. No numerical values of characters are used (not applicable here)
2. All expressions are properly parenthesized
3. All if/else statements use compound statements (none are used here)
4. No inappropriate assignments between numeric types

Let's check:
1. All operations use floating point numbers consistently
2. All expressions are properly parenthesized to indicate precedence
3. No if/else statements are used, so no issues there
4. All assignments are between the same types (all doubles)

This implementation should work according to the instructions. Let's test the implementation:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are implemented using the formulas provided
- Conjugate, absolute value, and exponent are also implemented
- All operations return new Complex numbers

Note: The implementation uses `std::sqrt`, `std::exp`, `std::cos`, and `std::sin` from the `<cmath>` header which is included.

I don't see any errors in the provided code. The implementation looks correct according to the instructions. However, there might be some issues with the unit tests or other parts of the code that aren't shown here. 

Since the user mentioned "Fix any errors below, if possible" and marked certain lines, but didn't specify what the errors are, I need to be careful. The marked lines seem to be the function declarations, which look fine.

Perhaps there are issues with the implementation not matching the expected interface? Or maybe there are missing operators? Let's think about what might be needed:

1. The instructions say to implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two complex numbers
2. We've implemented these as member operators, which is fine
3. We've also implemented conjugate, absolute value, and exponent

Wait, the absolute value is implemented as a member function `abs()`, but perhaps it needs to be a standalone function? Or maybe the tests expect something else?

Since the user provided the header and implementation, and they seem to match, I'll assume the implementation is correct. If there are specific errors, the user needs to provide more information.

However, to be thorough, let's make sure all operations are correctly implemented according to the mathematical formulas:

1. Addition: (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i ✅
2. Subtraction: (a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i ✅
3. Multiplication: (a + bi) * (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (bc + ad)i ✅
4. Division: (a + bi) / (c + di) = [(ac + bd)/(c² + d²)] + [(bc - ad)/(c² + d²)]i ✅
5. Conjugate: conj(a + bi) = a - bi ✅
6. Absolute value: |a + bi| = sqrt(a² + b²) ✅
7. Exponent: exp(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b)) ✅

All implementations match these formulas.

Since I can't see any errors, I'll provide the same code again. If there are specific errors, the user needs to provide more details.

I understand. The issue might be that the implementation needs to match a specific interface that's expected by the tests, which may not be visible to us. Since the tests are not provided, we need to ensure our implementation is correct and complete.

However, the marked lines seem to be the function declarations, which look fine. Let's make sure all operations are implemented correctly according to the instructions.

Wait, the instructions say to implement:
1. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers
2. conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number

All of these are implemented. But perhaps the tests expect non-member functions? Or perhaps there are specific function names?

Since the class is called `Complex` and the namespace is `complex_numbers`, maybe the tests are using a different interface.

Wait, the instructions say "Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers." So we're implementing from scratch.

Perhaps the tests expect to use functions like:
complex_numbers::add(a, b)
But our implementation uses operator overloading which is a valid approach.

Since the user provided the class interface, and it's marked, perhaps there are specific issues:
1. The real() and imag() functions need to be implemented to return the real and imaginary parts
2. All other operations need to be implemented

Let's make sure all implementations are correct. Since I can't see any errors, I'll re-implement with more careful attention to numerical stability and parentheses.

Wait, according to the rules, we need to ensure proper parenthesization:
1. All binary operations need to be properly parenthesized
2. Let's check our implementation

Here are the necessary fixes:

This ensures all operations are properly parenthesized according to the rules:
1. All binary operations are wrapped in parentheses
2. This makes the order of operations explicit

However, this may not be the actual issue. If the tests are failing, it could be due to floating point precision issues. But since the instructions don't mention anything about precision, we'll assume our implementation is correct.

Let's also make sure all the function declarations match their implementations. The marked lines in the header seem to indicate the function signatures, which look correct:
- Constructor takes two doubles
- real() and imag() are const member functions returning double
- Operators are all const member functions taking const Complex& and returning Complex

This implementation should now be correct according to the instructions and the provided rules. If there are still issues, we may need more information about the specific errors.

I understand. The tests are trying to perform operations between Complex numbers and doubles, but we only implemented operations between Complex numbers. We need to add overloads that can handle these cases.

Since we can't change the tests, we need to implement additional operators to handle:
1. Complex + double
2. double + Complex
3. Complex - double
4. double - Complex
5. Complex * double
6. double * Complex
7. Complex / double
8. double / Complex

These can be implemented as non-member functions to allow the double to be on the left-hand side.

Let's add these operators to the header and implement them in the source file.

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    // Operators
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
=======
    // Operators
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Friend operators for mixed-type operations
    friend Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
    friend Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
    friend Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these in the source file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
// Mixed-type operators implementation
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs.real_ + rhs), lhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs + rhs.real_), rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs.real_ - rhs), lhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs - rhs.real_), (-rhs.imag_));
}

Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs.real_ * rhs), (lhs.imag_ * rhs));
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real_), (lhs * rhs.imag_));
}

Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs.real_ / rhs), (lhs.imag_ / rhs));
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To compute lhs / (a + bi), we can use the formula for division
    // which is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal
    double denominator = ((rhs.real_ * rhs.real_) + (rhs.imag_ * rhs.imag_));
    double real_part = ((lhs * rhs.real_) / denominator);
    double imag_part = (((-lhs) * rhs.imag_) / denominator);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These implementations will handle all the cases where doubles are mixed with Complex numbers:
1. Adding a double to a complex number treats the double as a real number (imaginary part 0)
2. Subtracting follows similar logic
3. Multiplication scales both real and imaginary parts
4. Division needs to be handled carefully, especially when dividing a double by a complex number

Note: When implementing `double - Complex`, it's like `(real, 0) - (a + bi) = (real - a) + (-b)i`
Similarly, `double / Complex` uses the reciprocal formula: `real / (a + bi) = real * (a - bi) / (a² + b²)`

This should now handle all the test cases that are trying to mix doubles with complex numbers. Let's hope this resolves the compilation errors.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to properly handle access to private members in the friend functions. Since the friend functions are declared inside the class, they can access private members directly. However, we need to make sure they're implemented correctly.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. But perhaps there are issues with the way we're accessing private members. Let's use the public accessor functions instead to be safe.

Wait, but friend functions have access to private members, so that should be fine. Maybe there's another issue.

Actually, the implementation seems correct. Let's make sure all the operators are properly declared and implemented. Since the errors aren't specified, I'll assume everything is correct.

Wait, the implementation uses `real_` and `imag_` directly, which is fine for friend functions. Let's make sure all parentheses are correct according to the rules.

Since the implementation looks correct, I'll provide the same code but ensure all expressions are properly parenthesized according to the rules:

Wait, the implementation already seems to follow the rules. Let's re-implement using the accessor functions to see if that helps, even though friend functions should work:

Wait, the friend functions are part of the namespace, so they need to be declared in the namespace. Let's make sure they're properly scoped.

Here's a fixed implementation:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Mixed-type operators implementation
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs.real_ + rhs), lhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs + rhs.real_), rhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs.real_ - rhs), lhs.imag_);
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs - rhs.real_), (-rhs.imag_));
}

Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs.real_ * rhs), (lhs.imag_ * rhs));
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real_), (lhs * rhs.imag_));
}

Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs.real_ / rhs), (lhs.imag_ / rhs));
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To compute lhs / (a + bi), we can use the formula for division
    // which is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal
    double denominator = ((rhs.real_ * rhs.real_) + (rhs.imag_ * rhs.imag_));
    double real_part = ((lhs * rhs.real_) / denominator);
    double imag_part = (((-lhs) * rhs.imag_) / denominator);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
=======
// Mixed-type operators implementation
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs.real() + rhs), lhs.imag());
}

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs + rhs.real()), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs.real() - rhs), lhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs - rhs.real()), (-rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs.real() * rhs), (lhs.imag() * rhs));
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs * rhs.real()), (lhs * rhs.imag()));
}

Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex((lhs.real() / rhs), (lhs.imag() / rhs));
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To compute lhs / (a + bi), we can use the formula for division
    // which is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal
    double denominator = ((rhs.real() * rhs.real()) + (rhs.imag() * rhs.imag()));
    double real_part = ((lhs * rhs.real()) / denominator);
    double imag_part = (((-lhs) * rhs.imag()) / denominator);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation uses the public accessor functions `real()` and `imag()` instead of directly accessing private members, which should always work. This might resolve any potential access issues.

Since the friend functions are declared within the class, they are in the same namespace as the class, which is `complex_numbers`. This should be correct.

This implementation should now handle all the mixed-type operations between Complex numbers and doubles that the tests are expecting:
1. Complex + double
2. double + Complex
3. Complex - double
4. double - Complex
5. Complex * double
6. double * Complex
7. Complex / double
8. double / Complex

All operations are properly parenthesized according to the rules:
- All binary operations are wrapped in parentheses
- The order of operations is explicit

This should now resolve the compilation errors from the tests. Let's hope this implementation works.
