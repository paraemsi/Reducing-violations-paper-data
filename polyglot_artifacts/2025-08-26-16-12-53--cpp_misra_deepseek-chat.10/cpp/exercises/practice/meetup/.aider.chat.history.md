#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Every month, your partner meets up with their best friend.  
#### Both of them have very busy schedules, making it challenging to find a suitable date!  
#### Given your own busy schedule, your partner always double-checks potential meetup dates with you:  
####   
#### - "Can I meet up on the first Friday of next month?"  
#### - "What about the third Wednesday?"  
#### - "Maybe the last Sunday?"  
####   
#### In this month's call, your partner asked you this question:  
####   
#### - "I'd like to meet up on the teenth Thursday; is that okay?"  
####   
#### Confused, you ask what a "teenth" day is.  
#### Your partner explains that a teenth day, a concept they made up, refers to the days in a month that end in '-teenth':  
####   
#### - 13th (thirteenth)  
#### - 14th (fourteenth)  
#### - 15th (fifteenth)  
#### - 16th (sixteenth)  
#### - 17th (seventeenth)  
#### - 18th (eighteenth)  
#### - 19th (nineteenth)  
####   
#### As there are also seven weekdays, it is guaranteed that each day of the week has _exactly one_ teenth day each month.  
####   
#### Now that you understand the concept of a teenth day, you check your calendar.  
#### You don't have anything planned on the teenth Thursday, so you happily confirm the date with your partner.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to find the exact date of a meetup, given a month, year, weekday and week.  
####   
#### There are five week values to consider: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, `last`, `teenth`.  
####   
#### For example, you might be asked to find the date for the meetup on the first Monday in January 2018 (January 1, 2018).  
####   
#### Similarly, you might be asked to find:  
####   
#### - the third Tuesday of August 2019 (August 20, 2019)  
#### - the teenth Wednesday of May 2020 (May 13, 2020)  
#### - the fourth Sunday of July 2021 (July 25, 2021)  
#### - the last Thursday of November 2022 (November 24, 2022)  
#### - the teenth Saturday of August 1953 (August 15, 1953)  
####   
#### ## Teenth  
####   
#### The teenth week refers to the seven days in a month that end in '-teenth' (13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th).  
####   
#### If asked to find the teenth Saturday of August, 1953, we check its calendar:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
####     August 1953  
#### Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
####                    1  
####  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  
####  9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
#### 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  
#### 23 24 25 26 27 28 29  
#### 30 31  
#### ```  
####   
#### From this we find that the teenth Saturday is August 15, 1953.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: meetup.cpp meetup.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>

I understand. We need to implement a function to find the exact date for a meetup given a year, month, weekday, and week specification. Let's break this down:

1. The week can be "first", "second", "third", "fourth", "last", or "teenth"
2. The weekday can be any day of the week (Monday through Sunday)
3. For "teenth", we need to find the day that falls between 13-19 and matches the given weekday

Since the function signature isn't provided, I'll assume it's something like:
boost::gregorian::date meetup(int year, int month, const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday)

However, since we're working with C++, and the files are empty, we need to define the interface first.

Let's think about implementation:
1. We can use the Boost Date-Time library which is commonly used for date manipulations
2. Or we can use the C++20 chrono library, but it's not always available
3. Since the instructions don't specify, and to be safe, let's use a simple approach to find the dates

Wait, the user may be using a specific testing framework that expects certain includes.
Let's include necessary headers and implement the logic.

Since the files are empty, we need to define a class or function.
Let's assume there's a function to implement.

Wait, the namespace is meetup, so probably a class with a static method or just functions in the namespace.

Let's implement a function that takes year, month, week, and weekday as parameters and returns a date.

Here's the plan:
1. For "teenth": Check each day from 13 to 19 to find which matches the given weekday
2. For "first" to "fourth": Start from the first day of the month, find the first matching weekday, then add weeks
3. For "last": Start from the last day of the month and go backwards to find the last matching weekday

First, let's update the headers to include necessary types and declare the function.

Here are the necessary changes:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

namespace meetup {

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
=======
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>

namespace meetup {

class scheduler {
public:
    static boost::gregorian::date meetup(int year, int month, const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday);
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation in meetup.cpp, we need to parse the week and weekday, and find the appropriate date:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "meetup.h"

namespace meetup {

}  // namespace meetup
=======
#include "meetup.h"
#include <string>
#include <map>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>

namespace meetup {

using namespace boost::gregorian;

date scheduler::meetup(int year, int month, const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday) {
    // Map weekdays to numbers
    std::map<std::string, greg_weekday> weekday_map = {
        {"Monday", Monday},
        {"Tuesday", Tuesday},
        {"Wednesday", Wednesday},
        {"Thursday", Thursday},
        {"Friday", Friday},
        {"Saturday", Saturday},
        {"Sunday", Sunday}
    };
    
    // Get the target weekday
    auto it = weekday_map.find(weekday);
    if (it == weekday_map.end()) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid weekday");
    }
    greg_weekday target_weekday = it->second;
    
    if (week == "teenth") {
        // Check days 13 to 19
        for (int day = 13; day <= 19; day++) {
            date candidate(year, month, day);
            if (candidate.day_of_week() == target_weekday) {
                return candidate;
            }
        }
    } else {
        // For first, second, third, fourth, last
        first_day_of_the_week_in_month fd(target_weekday, month);
        last_day_of_the_week_in_month ld(target_weekday, month);
        
        if (week == "first") {
            return fd.get_date(year);
        } else if (week == "second") {
            return fd.get_date(year) + weeks(1);
        } else if (week == "third") {
            return fd.get_date(year) + weeks(2);
        } else if (week == "fourth") {
            return fd.get_date(year) + weeks(3);
        } else if (week == "last") {
            return ld.get_date(year);
        } else {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid week specification");
        }
    }
    throw std::runtime_error("No valid date found");
}

}  // namespace meetup
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue: the teenth case always returns within the loop, so the throw after the loop should never be reached.
But the compiler might not know that, so we need to handle it.

Wait, according to the problem statement, each day of the week has exactly one teenth day each month, so we'll always find one.
Thus, the throw after the teenth block will never be reached, which is fine.

This implementation uses the Boost Date-Time library which is a good choice for date manipulations.
However, if the tests don't link against Boost, we might need to find another approach.
But since the instructions don't specify, we'll proceed.

Note: The implementation uses weeks(1) which adds 7 days to get to the next occurrence of the same weekday.
This works because first_day_of_the_week_in_month gives the first occurrence, and adding weeks gives subsequent ones.

This should handle all the cases:
- first, second, third, fourth: by using the first occurrence and adding weeks
- last: using last_day_of_the_week_in_month
- teenth: by checking each day between 13-19

Let's hope this implementation meets the requirements.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle the requirements properly. Let's analyze the issues:

1. The function signature in the header uses `int` which violates the MISRA rules
2. We need to use fixed-width integer types
3. The implementation needs to be adjusted to use these types
4. We need to include the appropriate headers

Let's fix these issues:

First, update the header to use proper types and include necessary headers:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>

namespace meetup {

class scheduler {
public:
    static boost::gregorian::date meetup(int year, int month, const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday);
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
=======
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>
#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

namespace meetup {

class scheduler {
public:
    static boost::gregorian::date meetup(std::int32_t year, std::int32_t month, 
                                         const std::string& week, const std::string& weekday);
};

}  // namespace meetup

#endif // MEETUP_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, update the implementation to use proper types and handle the conversions:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "meetup.h"
#include <string>
#include <map>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>

    // Get the target weekday
    auto it = weekday_map.find(weekday);
    if (it == weekday_map.end()) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid weekday");
    }
    greg_weekday target_weekday = it->second;
    
    if (week == "teenth") {
        // Check days 13 to 19
        for (int day = 13; day <= 19; day++) {
            date candidate(year, month, day);
            if (candidate.day_of_week() == target_weekday) {
                return candidate;
            }
        }
    } else {
        // For first, second, third, fourth, last
        first_day_of_the_week_in_month fd(target_weekday, month);
        last_day_of_the_week_in_month ld(target_weekday, month);
        
        if (week == "first") {
            return fd.get_date(year);
        } else if (week == "second") {
            return fd.get_date(year) + weeks(1);
        } else if (week == "third") {
            return fd.get_date(year) + weeks(2);

```

However, there are some important points to note:
1. The Boost date constructor expects unsigned short for year, month, day, so we need to cast our std::int32_t parameters
2. This is acceptable because the values will always be within valid ranges (years are typically 1400-10000, months 1-12, days 1-31)
3. We're using std::int32_t which satisfies the MISRA rules

This implementation should now:
1. Use proper fixed-width integer types
2. Handle all the week specifications correctly
3. Find the teenth day by checking each day from 13 to 19
4. Use Boost's date functionality to find first, second, etc. occurrences

Since the problem guarantees that each weekday has exactly one teenth day per month, we don't need to worry about not finding a match in the teenth block.
However, the throw at the end is still there to satisfy the compiler's control flow analysis.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to work within the constraints. Let's fix the implementation to ensure it meets the requirements:

1. The function should be in the `meetup` namespace, not in a `scheduler` class
2. The function name should probably be just `meetup` to match the examples
3. Let's make sure we're using the correct interface

Wait, the tests may expect a certain interface. Since the header shows a class, we need to keep it that way.
But perhaps the implementation needs to be adjusted.

Actually, the implementation seems correct, but the function is in a class called `scheduler`, which might not be what the tests expect.
But since the user provided this header, we'll work with it.

Let's fix the implementation to ensure it's correct:

Wait, the implementation uses `boost::gregorian::date` which is fine, but we need to make sure all types are correct.
Let's ensure all integer types are properly handled.

Here are the necessary fixes:

However, there's a potential issue: the `date::year_type`, `date::month_type`, and `date::day_type` may not be directly accessible.
Let's use the types that the Boost constructors expect, which are typically unsigned short.

Wait, the implementation needs to be precise. Let's use the correct types:

Actually, the Boost documentation says the date constructor takes:
date(greg_year, greg_month, greg_day)

These are typically typedefs to unsigned short.

So we can use static_cast<unsigned short> which is appropriate.

But to be more precise, let's use the actual types from the boost namespace:

Wait, the implementation needs to be correct. Let's use:
static_cast<boost::gregorian::greg_year::value_type>(year)

But that's getting too complex. Let's trust that unsigned short is appropriate.

This implementation should now work within the provided interface and handle all the cases correctly.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to use proper types and handle the conversions correctly. The main issue is with the casts to `date::year_type`, etc., which may not be valid. Let's use the actual types that the Boost constructors expect.

Here are the necessary fixes:

```

This implementation now uses `static_cast<unsigned short>` which should match the types expected by the Boost Gregorian date constructors and functions. This should resolve any type-related issues while still adhering to the MISRA rules by using `std::int32_t` in the function signature.

Since the year, month, and day values will always be within valid ranges (years are reasonable, months 1-12, days 1-31), these casts are safe:
- Year: We can assume it's within the range of unsigned short (0-65535), which is true for any practical year
- Month: Always between 1-12
- Day: Always between 1-31

This implementation should now correctly handle all the specified cases:
1. "first", "second", "third", "fourth" using Boost's first_day_of_the_week_in_month
2. "last" using last_day_of_the_week_in_month
3. "teenth" by checking each day from 13 to 19 for the matching weekday

Let's hope this resolves any compilation issues.

> Finished summarizing chat history.  

I understand. The tests expect specific member functions in the `scheduler` class, not a single `meetup` function. Let's fix the implementation to match the test expectations.

The tests are calling functions like `monteenth()`, `first_monday()`, etc. which suggests that the `scheduler` class should have these as member functions that return dates.

Since the tests are passing a month and year when constructing the `scheduler` object, we need to store these values and use them in the member functions.

Here are the necessary fixes:

meetup.h
```cpp

This implementation should now match what the tests expect. Each test is calling specific member functions on the `scheduler` object, which uses the stored month and year to find the appropriate date.

I understand. The implementation needs to be adjusted to handle the types correctly. The issue is that `boost::gregorian::greg_month` is being used, but the tests may be passing an integer or another type. Let's fix this by using the correct types.

However, the tests are passing `boost::gregorian::May` which is of type `boost::date_time::month_functor<boost::gregorian::date>::month_type`, which is likely an enum or integral type. Let's make sure our implementation can handle this.

Wait, the implementation needs to use the correct types. Let's fix the implementation:

Here are the necessary fixes:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    scheduler(boost::gregorian::greg_month month, std::int32_t year);
=======
    scheduler(int month, std::int32_t year);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    std::int32_t year_;
    boost::gregorian::greg_month month_;
=======
    std::int32_t year_;
    int month_;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, update the implementation to handle these changes:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
scheduler::scheduler(greg_month month, std::int32_t year) 
    : month_(month), year_(year) {
}
=======
scheduler::scheduler(int month, std::int32_t year) 
    : month_(month), year_(year) {
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
date scheduler::find_teenth_day(greg_weekday weekday) const {
    for (std::int32_t day = 13; day <= 19; day++) {
        date candidate(year_, month_, day);
        if (candidate.day_of_week() == weekday) {
            return candidate;
        }
    }
    throw std::runtime_error("No teenth day found");
}

date scheduler::find_nth_day(std::int32_t n, greg_weekday weekday) const {
    first_day_of_the_week_in_month fd(weekday, month_);
    return fd.get_date(year_) + weeks(n - 1);
}

date scheduler::find_last_day(greg_weekday weekday) const {
    last_day_of_the_week_in_month ld(weekday, month_);
    return ld.get_date(year_);
}
=======
date scheduler::find_teenth_day(greg_weekday weekday) const {
    for (std::int32_t day = 13; day <= 19; day++) {
        date candidate(year_, month_, day);
        if (candidate.day_of_week() == weekday) {
            return candidate;
        }
    }
    throw std::runtime_error("No teenth day found");
}

date scheduler::find_nth_day(std::int32_t n, greg_weekday weekday) const {
    first_day_of_the_week_in_month fd(weekday, static_cast<greg_month::value_type>(month_));
    return fd.get_date(year_) + weeks(n - 1);
}

date scheduler::find_last_day(greg_weekday weekday) const {
    last_day_of_the_week_in_month ld(weekday, static_cast<greg_month::value_type>(month_));
    return ld.get_date(year_);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue: `greg_month::value_type` may not be correct. Let's use `unsigned short` which is what the Boost constructors typically expect:

Wait, the month needs to be cast to the type that `first_day_of_the_week_in_month` expects, which is likely `greg_month::month_type` or an enum. Let's use a direct cast:

Wait, the Boost months are enums, so we can cast the integer to the appropriate enum type:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
date scheduler::find_nth_day(std::int32_t n, greg_weekday weekday) const {
    first_day_of_the_week_in_month fd(weekday, static_cast<greg_month::value_type>(month_));
    return fd.get_date(year_) + weeks(n - 1);
}

date scheduler::find_last_day(greg_weekday weekday) const {
    last_day_of_the_week_in_month ld(weekday, static_cast<greg_month::value_type>(month_));
    return ld.get_date(year_);
}
=======
date scheduler::find_nth_day(std::int32_t n, greg_weekday weekday) const {
    first_day_of_the_week_in_month fd(weekday, static_cast<date::month_type>(month_));
    return fd.get_date(static_cast<date::year_type>(year_)) + weeks(n - 1);
}

date scheduler::find_last_day(greg_weekday weekday) const {
    last_day_of_the_week_in_month ld(weekday, static_cast<date::month_type>(month_));
    return ld.get_date(static_cast<date::year_type>(year_));
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Also, fix the teenth function to use proper casts:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
date scheduler::find_teenth_day(greg_weekday weekday) const {
    for (std::int32_t day = 13; day <= 19; day++) {
        date candidate(year_, month_, day);
        if (candidate.day_of_week() == weekday) {
            return candidate;
        }
    }
    throw std::runtime_error("No teenth day found");
}
=======
date scheduler::find_teenth_day(greg_weekday weekday) const {
    for (std::int32_t day = 13; day <= 19; day++) {
        date candidate(static_cast<date::year_type>(year_), 
                       static_cast<date::month_type>(month_), 
                       static_cast<date::day_type>(day));
        if (candidate.day_of_week() == weekday) {
            return candidate;
        }
    }
    throw std::runtime_error("No teenth day found");
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should now handle the types correctly by casting the integer month to the appropriate enum type that Boost expects, and the year to the appropriate type. This should resolve any compilation issues while maintaining the functionality.

I understand. The tests are passing `boost::gregorian::May` which is an enum value, not an integer. We need to adjust the implementation to handle this correctly.

The issue is that the constructor expects an `int`, but the tests are passing a `boost::gregorian::greg_month` (or similar enum type). Let's fix this:

Here are the necessary changes:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    scheduler(int month, std::int32_t year);
=======
    scheduler(boost::gregorian::greg_month month, std::int32_t year);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    std::int32_t year_;
    int month_;
=======
    std::int32_t year_;
    boost::gregorian::greg_month month_;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, update the implementation to match:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
scheduler::scheduler(int month, std::int32_t year) 
    : month_(month), year_(year) {
}
=======
scheduler::scheduler(boost::gregorian::greg_month month, std::int32_t year) 
    : month_(month), year_(year) {
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
date scheduler::find_teenth_day(greg_weekday weekday) const {
    for (std::int32_t day = 13; day <= 19; day++) {
        date candidate(static_cast<date::year_type>(year_), 
                       static_cast<date::month_type>(month_), 
                       static_cast<date::day_type>(day));
        if (candidate.day_of_week() == weekday) {
            return candidate;
        }
    }
    throw std::runtime_error("No teenth day found");
}

date scheduler::find_nth_day(std::int32_t n, greg_weekday weekday) const {
    first_day_of_the_week_in_month fd(weekday, static_cast<date::month_type>(month_));
    return fd.get_date(static_cast<date::year_type>(year_)) + weeks(n - 1);
}

date scheduler::find_last_day(greg_weekday weekday) const {
    last_day_of_the_week_in_month ld(weekday, static_cast<date::month_type>(month_));
    return ld.get_date(static_cast<date::year_type>(year_));
}
=======
date scheduler::find_teenth_day(greg_weekday weekday) const {
    for (std::int32_t day = 13; day <= 19; day++) {
        date candidate(static_cast<date::year_type>(year_), 
                       month_, 
                       static_cast<date::day_type>(day));
        if (candidate.day_of_week() == weekday) {
            return candidate;
        }
    }
    throw std::runtime_error("No teenth day found");
}

date scheduler::find_nth_day(std::int32_t n, greg_weekday weekday) const {
    first_day_of_the_week_in_month fd(weekday, month_);
    return fd.get_date(static_cast<date::year_type>(year_)) + weeks(n - 1);
}

date scheduler::find_last_day(greg_weekday weekday) const {
    last_day_of_the_week_in_month ld(weekday, month_);
    return ld.get_date(static_cast<date::year_type>(year_));
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the month is treated as the correct enum type that Boost expects, which should resolve any type mismatch issues. The `boost::gregorian::greg_month` is the appropriate type to use with the Boost date functions, and it matches what the tests are passing to the constructor.

Since `month_` is now of type `boost::gregorian::greg_month`, we don't need to cast it when passing to `first_day_of_the_week_in_month` and `last_day_of_the_week_in_month` constructors, which should now work correctly.

This should now compile and work with the tests that are passing enum month values like `boost::gregorian::May`.

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle the types correctly. The issue is that `boost::gregorian::greg_month` may not be the right type to use. Let's use the actual month type from the Boost library.

The tests are passing `boost::gregorian::May` which is likely of type `boost::date_time::month_functor<boost::gregorian::date>::month_type`. Let's fix this:

Here are the necessary changes:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    scheduler(boost::gregorian::greg_month month, std::int32_t year);
=======
    scheduler(boost::date_time::month_functor<boost::gregorian::date>::month_type month, std::int32_t year);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    std::int32_t year_;
    boost::gregorian::greg_month month_;
=======
    std::int32_t year_;
    boost::date_time::month_functor<boost::gregorian::date>::month_type month_;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, update the implementation to match:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
scheduler::scheduler(boost::gregorian::greg_month month, std::int32_t year) 
    : month_(month), year_(year) {
}
=======
scheduler::scheduler(boost::date_time::month_functor<boost::gregorian::date>::month_type month, std::int32_t year) 
    : month_(month), year_(year) {
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, this type is quite long. Let's create a type alias to make it more readable:

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>
#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

namespace meetup {
=======
#if !defined(MEETUP_H)
#define MEETUP_H

#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>
#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

namespace meetup {

using month_type = boost::date_time::month_functor<boost::gregorian::date>::month_type;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    scheduler(boost::date_time::month_functor<boost::gregorian::date>::month_type month, std::int32_t year);
=======
    scheduler(month_type month, std::int32_t year);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

meetup.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    std::int32_t year_;
    boost::date_time::month_functor<boost::gregorian::date>::month_type month_;
=======
    std::int32_t year_;
    month_type month_;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, update the implementation to use the alias:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
scheduler::scheduler(boost::date_time::month_functor<boost::gregorian::date>::month_type month, std::int32_t year) 
    : month_(month), year_(year) {
}
=======
scheduler::scheduler(month_type month, std::int32_t year) 
    : month_(month), year_(year) {
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Wait, we need to include the type alias in meetup.cpp as well. Let's add it:

meetup.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "meetup.h"
#include <string>
#include <map>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>
#include <cstdint>

namespace meetup {

using namespace boost::gregorian;
=======
#include "meetup.h"
#include <string>
#include <map>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <boost/date_time/gregorian/gregorian.hpp>
#include <cstdint>

namespace meetup {

using namespace boost::gregorian;
using month_type = boost::date_time::month_functor<boost::gregorian::date>::month_type;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This should now correctly handle the month type that the tests are passing. The implementation should work with the Boost month enums like `boost::gregorian::May`.

Let's hope this resolves the compilation issues. The implementation logic itself seems correct, so once the types match, it should work as expected.
