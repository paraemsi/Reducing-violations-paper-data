#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of [perfect](#perfect), [abundant](#abundant), or [deficient](#deficient) based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The _aliquot sum_ is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of `15` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.  
####   
#### ## Perfect  
####   
#### A number is perfect when it equals its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `6` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`  
#### - `28` is a perfect number because `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`  
####   
#### ## Abundant  
####   
#### A number is abundant when it is less than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `12` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
#### - `24` is an abundant number because `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36`  
####   
#### ## Deficient  
####   
#### A number is deficient when it is greater than its aliquot sum.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `8` is a deficient number because `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`  
#### - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is [perfect](#perfect).  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is [abundant](#abundant) or [deficient](#deficient).  
####   
#### [nicomachus]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachus
