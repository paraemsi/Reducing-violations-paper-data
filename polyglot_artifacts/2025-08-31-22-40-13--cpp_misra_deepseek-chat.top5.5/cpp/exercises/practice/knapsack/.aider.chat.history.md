#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a fancy store.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value and weight.  
#### Bob would gladly take all of the items, but his knapsack can only hold so much weight.  
#### Bob has to carefully consider which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to determine which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized, taking into account the knapsack's carrying capacity.  
####   
#### Items will be represented as a list of items.  
#### Each item will have a weight and value.  
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Maximum Weight: 10  
#### ```  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.cpp knapsack.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
####   
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always enclose the body of every `if` and every `else` in a compound statement:    
####   `if (cond) { … }`, `else { … }`  
#### - The sole exception: `else if (cond)` is allowed without braces; all other `else` bodies need `{}`.  
#### - Do not place any statements (even one) outside braces following `if`/`else`; indentation is irrelevant.  
#### - Never add a stray semicolon after the `if (cond)` or `else` keyword; the next `{}` must start the body.  
#### - Example: instead of    
####   `if (x) doSomething();`    
####   write    
####   `if (x) { doSomething(); }`  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Do not convert between character-category types (`char`, `signed/unsigned char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`) and any non-character type (int, bool, float, enum, pointer); avoid both implicit and explicit casts.    
#### - Initialise or assign character objects only with matching character literals (e.g. `char c = '\n';`, `wchar_t w = L'x';`).    
#### - Use integer objects for numeric codes (e.g. `int code = 97;`) instead of storing them in a character object.    
#### - Never use characters in arithmetic, relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical, or boolean-context expressions; employ library helpers such as `std::char_traits<>::to_int_type()` / `to_char_type()` when numeric value access is unavoidable.    
#### - Equality comparisons `==` / `!=` between operands of the same character type are permitted; all other operations on character operands are disallowed.    
#### - Cast a character result to `void` only when discarding the return value of a function call; any other cast involving a character type violates the rule.    
#### - Using characters in unevaluated operands (`sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept`, `alignof`) is allowed.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I understand. We need to implement a function to solve the classic 0/1 knapsack problem, where we can either take an item or leave it, and we want to maximize the total value without exceeding the maximum weight capacity.

Since all values are positive, and we need to find the maximum value, we can use dynamic programming. The standard approach uses a DP table where dp[i][w] represents the maximum value that can be obtained using the first i items with a maximum weight of w.

However, to be efficient, we can use a 1D array to save space.

Let's implement a function in the knapsack namespace that takes a list of items and a maximum weight, and returns the maximum value.

Since the weights can be up to the maximum weight, which could be large, but the number of items is probably manageable, this approach should work.

Wait, the instructions don't specify the maximum weight, but we need to be efficient. Let's implement the standard dynamic programming approach.

First, let's add the necessary include and function declaration to the header file.

Here are the necessary changes:

knapsack.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    int weight;
    int value;
};

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
=======
#ifndef KNAPSACK_H
#define KNAPSACK_H

#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

struct Item
{
    std::int32_t weight;
    std::int32_t value;
};

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items);

} // namespace knapsack

#endif // KNAPSACK_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement the function in knapsack.cpp:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"

namespace knapsack
{

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty()) 
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores the maximum value for weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items) 
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w) 
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value)) 
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    return *std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there are a few things to note:
1. We need to ensure that all types are appropriate (using std::int32_t)
2. We need to follow the MISRA rules, which we've done by using fixed-width integers
3. All if statements have their bodies in braces
4. We're using proper parentheses in expressions

This implementation uses a 1D DP array to save space, which is efficient. It processes each item and for each possible weight from maximum down to the item's weight, it updates the maximum value that can be obtained.

However, the maximum value may not always be at dp[maximum_weight], so we need to find the maximum value in the entire dp array. This is correct because sometimes we might not be able to fill the knapsack completely, but we still want the maximum value.

This implementation should work for the provided example:
Items: weight 5 value 10, weight 4 value 40, weight 6 value 30, weight 4 value 50
Maximum weight: 10

Processing:
- For item 1 (5, 10): Update weights 10 down to 5
- For item 2 (4, 40): Update weights 10 down to 4
- For item 3 (6, 30): Update weights 10 down to 6
- For item 4 (4, 50): Update weights 10 down to 4

The maximum value should be 90, which matches the example (items 2 and 4: 40 + 50 = 90, weight 4 + 4 = 8 <= 10)

I understand. The implementation needs to be fixed to handle cases where the maximum weight is 0, and to ensure it always works correctly. Let's fix the implementation.

The issue is that when maximum_weight is 0, we need to handle it properly. Also, we need to make sure all types are consistent.

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but let's test it with the provided example:
Items: weight 5 value 10, weight 4 value 40, weight 6 value 30, weight 4 value 50
Maximum weight: 10

But to be thorough, let's ensure it always works.

Here are the fixes:

knapsack.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if (items.empty()) 
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores the maximum value for weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items) 
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= item.weight; --w) 
        {
            if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value)) 
            {
                dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value in the dp array
    return *std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}

} // namespace knapsack
=======
#include "knapsack.h"
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdint>

namespace knapsack
{

std::int32_t maximum_value(std::int32_t maximum_weight, const std::vector<Item>& items)
{
    if ((maximum_weight == 0) || (items.empty())) 
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[w] stores the maximum value for weight w
    std::vector<std::int32_t> dp(maximum_weight + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& item : items) 
    {
        // To avoid reusing the same item, process weights in reverse
        for (std::int32_t w = maximum_weight; w >= 0; --w) 
        {
            if (w >= item.weight) 
            {
                if (dp[w] < (dp[w - item.weight] + item.value)) 
                {
                    dp[w] = dp[w - item.weight] + item.value;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The maximum value will be at dp[maximum_weight]
    // But to be safe, we can find the maximum in the entire array
    // However, since all values are non-negative, and we're always adding, dp is non-decreasing
    return dp[maximum_weight];
}

} // namespace knapsack
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, there's a potential issue: the maximum value might not always be at dp[maximum_weight] if some items have zero weight, but the problem says all values are strictly positive, and weights are probably non-negative too. But to be precise, we should find the maximum value in the dp array.

Wait, the problem says "values given will be strictly positive", which means they're always greater than zero, so the dp array will be non-decreasing. Therefore, the maximum value will always be at dp[maximum_weight].

But to be absolutely correct, let's always find the maximum value in the dp array:

Wait, but the implementation needs to be efficient. Let's use the maximum element approach:

Wait, but the problem says Bob can take only one of each item, which is the 0/1 knapsack problem, which our implementation handles correctly.

This implementation should now handle cases where maximum_weight is 0 by returning 0 immediately.

However, there's a slight optimization: we can break early when w >= item.weight, which we're already doing in the condition. But to follow the condition, we need to adjust the loop.

Actually, the implementation is correct. Let's test it with the provided example:
- Process each item and update the dp array from maximum_weight down to item's weight
- This ensures we don't use the same item more than once

This implementation should work. Let's proceed.
