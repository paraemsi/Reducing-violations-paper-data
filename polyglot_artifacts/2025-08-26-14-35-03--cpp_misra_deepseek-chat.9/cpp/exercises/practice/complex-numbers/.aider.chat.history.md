#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.  
####   
#### `a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.  
#### The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.  
#### The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.  
####   
#### The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:  
#### `(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,  
#### `(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.  
####   
#### Multiplication result is by definition  
#### `(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.  
####   
#### The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is  
#### `1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:  
#### `(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.  
####   
#### Raising e to a complex exponent can be expressed as `e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`, the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,  
#### - conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.  
####   
#### Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: complex_numbers.cpp complex_numbers.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not declare variables, parameters, or return types with: signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long  
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types: std::int8_t / std::uint8_t, std::int16_t / std::uint16_t, std::int32_t / std::uint32_t, std::int64_t / std::uint64_t  
#### - If exact width is not critical, create a typedef/using alias to a fixed-width type and use the alias (raw basic type only inside the alias definition)  
#### - main may stay int main(int argc, char* argv[])  
#### - Keep the mandatory int dummy in postfix operators: T operator++(int) / operator--(int)  
####   
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep source and target numeric types identical in category (integral / floating), signedness, and size; otherwise, refactor or cast explicitly.  
#### - Widening integral assignment is allowed only if:  
####   • same category (integral) and signedness,  
####   • target is larger,  
####   • source is a simple id-expression (e.g. var → uint32_t biggerVar).  
#### - Never narrow: avoid assigning larger → smaller width, or changing signedness (e.g. int32_t → uint8_t, uint32_t → int32_t).  
#### - Do not mix categories: integral ↔ floating assignments are forbidden unless using a constant that fits target range.  
#### - Floating-point constant may be assigned to a larger floating type (e.g. 1.0f → double).  
#### - Integer constant expression may be assigned if the value fits the target’s range (or a bit-field that can hold it).  
#### - Treat initializations, by-value parameter passing, return-by-value, lambda captures, and switch case labels exactly like assignments—apply the same checks.  
#### - When an unavoidable conversion is required, use a deliberate static_cast<target_type>(value) and justify in code review.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Always parenthesize a binary or ternary sub-expression when it is an operand of another operator with a different precedence level.  
####   • Example: instead of `int a = p1 * p2 + 1;` use `int a = p1 * (p2 + 1);`  
#### - Parentheses may be omitted only when adjacent operators have the **same** precedence (e.g., `a + b - c`, `x << y >> z`).  
#### - Wrap each relational or equality test before combining with `&&`, `||`, or `?:`.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 == 1) && (p2 > 1))`  
#### - Always parenthesize arithmetic terms before using them in another arithmetic, bitwise, shift, logical, or conditional expression.  
####   • Example: `if((p1 + p2) != (p1 - p2))`  
#### - Unary operators (`-x`, `!x`, `*ptr`, `&var`, cast, etc.) do **not** need extra parentheses beyond normal usage.  
#### - Apply the rule consistently in all C/C++ code, even though preprocessors and user-defined operators are not checked by static analysis.  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I'll implement a complex number class with the required operations. Let's start by defining the Complex class and implementing all the operations.

First, we need to include the necessary headers and define the class structure.

Here are the planned changes:

1. Add a Complex class with real and imaginary parts
2. Implement constructors and operators
3. Implement member functions for conjugate, abs, and exp

Since we're dealing with floating point numbers, we'll use double precision.

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
=======
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:
    double real_;
    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    
    // Operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Other functions
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement all these methods in the .cpp file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "complex_numbers.h"

namespace complex_numbers {

}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
#include "complex_numbers.h"
#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

Complex::Complex(double real, double imag) : real_(real), imag_(imag) {}

double Complex::real() const {
    return real_;
}

double Complex::imag() const {
    return imag_;
}

Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_ + other.real_, imag_ + other.imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator-(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real_ - other.real_, imag_ - other.imag_);
}

Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex& other) const {
    double real_part = (real_ * other.real_) - (imag_ * other.imag_);
    double imag_part = (imag_ * other.real_) + (real_ * other.imag_);
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}

double Complex::abs() const {
    return std::sqrt((real_ * real_) + (imag_ * imag_));
}

Complex Complex::conj() const {
    return Complex(real_, -imag_);
}

Complex Complex::exp() const {
    // e^(a + bi) = e^a * (cos(b) + i*sin(b))
    double magnitude = std::exp(real_);
    return Complex(magnitude * std::cos(imag_), magnitude * std::sin(imag_));
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, I need to ensure that all operations follow the MISRA C++ rules:
1. No mixing of floating point types - all operations use double consistently
2. Parentheses are used appropriately to indicate precedence

Looking at the implementation:
- All operations use double precision consistently
- Parentheses are used where necessary to make precedence clear
- No integer types are used where floating point types are expected

This implementation should satisfy the requirements:
1. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are implemented using the provided formulas
2. Conjugate, absolute value, and exponent are implemented correctly
3. All operations use proper floating point arithmetic
4. The implementation follows the provided rules

Note: The implementation uses `std::exp`, `std::cos`, and `std::sin` from the `<cmath>` header which are standard library functions.

I understand. The issue is that the implementation needs to match the interface expected by the tests. The tests might be expecting different function signatures or a different approach. Let's look at the provided implementation and see what needs to be fixed.

Since the tests are not provided, I need to make sure the implementation follows best practices and the instructions precisely. The instructions say not to change the names of existing functions or classes, which suggests that the interface may be fixed.

Wait, the implementation seems correct, but perhaps the tests expect the functions to be non-member functions or have different signatures. But the class is named 'Complex' which matches.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the issue is that the tests expect the operations to be implemented as non-member functions? Or perhaps there are other requirements.

Wait, the instructions say to "implement the following operations" which could be interpreted as standalone functions, not necessarily member functions. But the class structure is already provided.

Since the class is already defined, and the implementation uses member functions, this should be fine. But perhaps the tests expect certain functions to be non-member.

Wait, the implementation seems to be correct. Let's make sure all operations are implemented correctly according to the formulas:

1. Addition: (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i
2. Subtraction: (a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i
3. Multiplication: (a + bi)*(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (bc + ad)i
4. Division: (a + bi)/(c + di) = [(ac + bd)/(c² + d²)] + [(bc - ad)/(c² + d²)]i
5. Conjugate: a + bi -> a - bi
6. Absolute value: sqrt(a² + b²)
7. Exponent: e^(a + bi) = e^a*(cos(b) + i*sin(b))

All these are correctly implemented.

Perhaps the issue is with the interface. Let's make sure all functions are public and accessible.

Wait, the implementation looks correct. Maybe the tests are using a different interface. Since I can't see the tests, I need to trust that the implementation is correct.

However, to be thorough, let's add some error checking for division by zero:
But the instructions don't mention error handling, so this might not be necessary.

Actually, the implementation looks correct. Perhaps the issue is that the tests expect the functions to be in the namespace but not part of a class? But the class is already defined.

Wait, the instructions say to "modify the supplied files", which include a class definition. So the implementation should be correct.

Since I can't see any errors, I'll assume the implementation is correct and matches the interface. If there are specific errors, please provide more details.

However, to ensure robustness, let's add a check for division by zero:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
=======
Complex Complex::operator/(const Complex& other) const {
    double denominator = (other.real_ * other.real_) + (other.imag_ * other.imag_);
    // Check for division by zero
    if (denominator == 0.0) {
        // Handle division by zero - according to IEEE 754, this will produce infinity or NaN
        // which is probably what we want
    }
    double real_part = ((real_ * other.real_) + (imag_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    double imag_part = ((imag_ * other.real_) - (real_ * other.imag_)) / denominator;
    return Complex(real_part, imag_part);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

But this doesn't change the behavior, it just adds a comment.

Since I can't see any actual errors, and the implementation seems correct, I'll provide the implementation as is. If there are specific error messages, please share them.

Wait, perhaps the tests expect the real() and imag() functions to be named re() and im() or something else? But the interface shows real() and imag().

Since the implementation matches the interface provided, it should be correct.

If there are still issues, please provide the exact error messages or test cases that are failing.

I understand. The tests expect to be able to perform operations between Complex numbers and doubles, which means we need to implement additional operators to handle these cases. Let's add non-member operator overloads to support these operations.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Add friend or non-member operator overloads for +, -, *, / between Complex and double
2. Make sure they work in both orders (Complex + double and double + Complex)

Here are the required changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    // Operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Other functions
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
=======
    // Operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Other functions
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
};

// Non-member operators to handle operations with doubles
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's implement these non-member operators in the .cpp file:

complex_numbers.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
}  // namespace complex_numbers
=======
// Implement non-member operators
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real() + rhs, lhs.imag());
}

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs + rhs.real(), rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real() - rhs, lhs.imag());
}

Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs - rhs.real(), -rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real() * rhs, lhs.imag() * rhs);
}

Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs * rhs.real(), lhs * rhs.imag());
}

Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs) {
    return Complex(lhs.real() / rhs, lhs.imag() / rhs);
}

Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
    // To divide a double by a complex number, we can treat the double as a complex number with imaginary part 0
    // and use the complex division formula
    Complex lhs_complex(lhs, 0.0);
    return lhs_complex / rhs;
}

}  // namespace complex_numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, the implementation of `operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs)` needs to be correct. Let's use the division formula:
(a + 0i)/(c + di) = (ac + 0*d)/(c² + d²) + (0*c - a*d)/(c² + d²)i = (a*c)/(c² + d²) + (-a*d)/(c² + d²)i

Wait, but a is lhs, which is a double, and c + di is rhs
So:
real part = (lhs * rhs.real()) / denominator
imag part = (-lhs * rhs.imag()) / denominator
where denominator = rhs.real()² + rhs.imag()²

Let's fix that implementation:

Wait, but we need to make sure to include these operators in the complex_numbers namespace
Since they're defined within the namespace block, they will be

Wait, the implementation needs to be in the namespace, which it is
Let's fix the implementation:

Wait, the implementation of operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs) needs to be correct
Here's the fixed implementation:

Wait, but the implementation above is correct:
Treat lhs as a complex number (lhs + 0i) and use complex division
Which is what we want

This should now handle all the cases where doubles are used with complex numbers:
- c + 5.0 -> operator+(const Complex&, double)
- 5.0 + c -> operator+(double, const Complex&)
- c - 4.0 -> operator-(const Complex&, double)
- 4.0 - c -> operator-(double, const Complex&)
- c * 5.0 -> operator*(const Complex&, double)
- 5.0 * c -> operator*(double, const Complex&)
- c / 10.0 -> operator/(const Complex&, double)
- 5.0 / c -> operator/(double, const Complex&)

This should now satisfy all the test cases. Let's hope this resolves the compilation errors.

I see the issue. There's an extra closing brace and semicolon on line 38 which is causing a syntax error. Let's fix that.

Here are the necessary changes:

complex_numbers.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:

    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    
    // Operations

};

// Non-member operators to handle operations with doubles

Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);

Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
};

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#if !defined(COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H)
#define COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H

#include <cmath>

namespace complex_numbers {

class Complex {
private:

    double imag_;
public:
    Complex(double real, double imag);
    double real() const;
    double imag() const;
    
    // Operations
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const;
    Complex operator/(const Complex& other) const;
    
    // Other functions
    double abs() const;
    Complex conj() const;
    Complex exp() const;
};

// Non-member operators to handle operations with doubles
Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator+(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator-(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator-(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator*(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator*(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);
Complex operator/(const Complex& lhs, double rhs);
Complex operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs);

}  // namespace complex_numbers

#endif  // COMPLEX_NUMBERS_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This removes the extra `};` on line 38 which was causing a syntax error. The rest of the implementation looks correct and should now compile properly.

I don't see any obvious errors in the provided code. The implementation looks correct and should handle all the operations between complex numbers and doubles. However, let's make sure everything is properly implemented.

Wait, the implementation of `operator/(double lhs, const Complex& rhs)` uses `lhs_complex / rhs`, which calls `Complex::operator/`. This is correct and should work.

Since the implementation seems correct, and the tests were failing due to missing operators which are now implemented, this should now work. Let's proceed.

However, to be thorough, let's make sure all operators are properly declared and defined within the `complex_numbers` namespace, which they are.

Since the implementation looks correct, and the files have been added to the chat, I believe the code should now compile and pass the tests. If there are still issues, please provide specific error messages.
