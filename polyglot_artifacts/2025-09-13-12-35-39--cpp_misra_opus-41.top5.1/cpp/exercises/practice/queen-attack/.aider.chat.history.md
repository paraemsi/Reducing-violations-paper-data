#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given the position of two queens on a chess board, indicate whether or not they are positioned so that they can attack each other.  
####   
#### In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the same row, column, or diagonal.  
####   
#### A chessboard can be represented by an 8 by 8 array.  
####   
#### So if you are told the white queen is at `c5` (zero-indexed at column 2, row 3) and the black queen at `f2` (zero-indexed at column 5, row 6), then you know that the set-up is like so:  
####   
#### ![A chess board with two queens. Arrows emanating from the queen at c5 indicate possible directions of capture along file, rank and diagonal.](https://assets.exercism.org/images/exercises/queen-attack/queen-capture.svg)  
####   
#### You are also able to answer whether the queens can attack each other.  
#### In this case, that answer would be yes, they can, because both pieces share a diagonal.  
####

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: queen_attack.h queen_attack.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  
####   
#### In newly generated code obey the following MISRA C++ rules:  
####   
#### <rules>  
#### The names of the standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types should not be used  
#### - Do not use the keywords signed/unsigned char, short, int, long, or long long (and their unsigned forms) for variables, parameters, or return types.    
#### - Instead, include <cstdint> and use fixed-width types such as std::int8_t, std::uint16_t, std::int32_t, std::uint64_t, or project-specific typedefs/aliases that wrap them.    
#### - int is permitted only for the main() return type, its parameters (argc, argv), and as the dummy int in postfix ++/-- operators; avoid it elsewhere.    
#### - Typedef/using declarations that create aliases are allowed and encouraged for readability.    
#### - Plain char is covered by another rule; avoid it for integers.  
####   
#### Use parentheses to indicate the precedence of operators in expressions  
#### - Parenthesize every sub-expression that combines binary or ternary operators with different precedence levels ( *, /, %, +, -, <<, >>, <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, &, ^, |, &&, ||, ?: ).    
#### - Omit parentheses only when adjacent operators share the exact same precedence and associativity (e.g. `a + b - c`, `x & y ^ z`).    
#### - Unary operators may remain unparenthesized when used inside a larger expression (`a * -b` is OK).    
#### - Never rely on default precedence in conditions, assignments, returns, or initializers; make evaluation order explicit: `if ((a == 1) && (b > 0))`, `val = a * (b + 1);`.    
#### - Treat overloaded operators with the same caution; add parentheses for clarity even if the rule does not mandate it.    
#### - Example pitfalls: avoid `a * b + 1`, `if (a + b != c - d)`, `if (x == 0 && y > 1)`; rewrite with parentheses.  
####   
#### The numerical value of a character shall not be used  
#### - Never convert character types (‘char’, ‘signed/unsigned char’, ‘wchar_t’, ‘char16_t’, ‘char32_t’) to or from any non-character arithmetic type (int, bool, enum, float, …); forbid both implicit assignments and casts.    
#### - Do not perform arithmetic, bitwise, relational (<, >, <=, >=), or ++/-- on character objects; only == and != between identical character types are allowed.    
#### - Initialise/assign character variables exclusively with character literals of the same category (e.g., char c = '\n'; wchar_t w = L'x';), not numeric constants.    
#### - When an integer representation is unavoidable, use library helpers such as std::char_traits<CharT>::to_int_type(), never rely on direct conversion.    
#### - Use <cctype>/<cwctype> utilities (std::isalpha, std::tolower, …) instead of numeric range checks on characters.    
#### - Raw byte or small-integer data should be held in std::byte, std::uint8_t, or int8_t, not in char-family types.    
#### - Unevaluated operands (sizeof, decltype, alignof) and casts to void of a function call returning a character are permissible.  
####   
#### Assignment between numeric types shall be appropriate  
#### - Keep numeric assignments strictly safe: identical type category, signedness and size, or an allowed widening/constant case    
#### - OK: same category & signedness, destination wider, source is a single variable (id-expression) ‒ e.g. `uint32_t big = small8;`    
#### - OK: floating-point constant → wider floating type ‒ e.g. `long double ld = 1.0f;`    
#### - OK: integer constant/constant expression → any numeric type (or bit-field) whose range can hold the value ‒ e.g. `float f = 42;`, `uint8_t u = 255;`    
#### - Otherwise: do NOT assign, initialise, pass by value, return, or use in a `case` label    
####   • No wider→narrower size (e.g. `uint8_t u = uint32_t_val;`)    
####   • No signed↔unsigned change (e.g. `uint32_t = int32_t;`)    
####   • No integer↔floating conversion except the constant cases above    
####   • No value that exceeds target range    
#### - For widening, use a variable, not an arithmetic expression; if you must convert, use an explicit cast that yields a compliant source type first    
#### - Apply the same checks in constructors, default arguments, lambda captures, operator calls, etc. ‒ every by-value transfer counts as an assignment    
#### - Treat unscoped enums as their underlying integral type when checking these rules  
####   
#### The statement forming the body of an 'if' or 'else' statement should be a compound statement  
#### - Always wrap the body of every `if` in `{ … }`, even if it is a single statement    
#### - Always wrap the body of every `else` in `{ … }`; braces may be omitted only when the `else` is immediately followed by another `if` (`else if`)    
#### - Do not place any non-braced statement directly after `if (…)` or `else`    
#### - Never write `if (condition);` — replace with a braced empty block or remove the statement    
#### - Keep braces and indentation consistent so the controlled block is visually unambiguous  
#### </rules>  
####   
####  

I'll implement the queen attack checker following the instructions and MISRA C++ rules. The solution needs to:

1. Create a `queen` class to represent a queen's position on the chess board
2. Implement a method to check if two queens can attack each other (same row, column, or diagonal)

Here are the changes needed:

## Changes Explanation:
1. **queen_attack.h**: Define a `queen` class with position storage and a `can_attack` method
2. **queen_attack.cpp**: Implement the constructor and attack logic checking for same row, column, or diagonal

queen_attack.h
```
#if !defined(QUEEN_ATTACK_H)
#define QUEEN_ATTACK_H

#include <cstdint>
#include <utility>

namespace queen_attack {

class queen {
public:
    // Constructor taking position as (row, column)
    queen(std::int32_t row = 0, std::int32_t column = 0);
    
    // Alternative constructor taking a pair
    queen(std::pair<std::int32_t, std::int32_t> position);
    
    // Check if this queen can attack another queen
    bool can_attack(const queen& other) const;
    
    // Get position as a pair
    std::pair<std::int32_t, std::int32_t> position() const;

private:
    std::int32_t row_;
    std::int32_t column_;
};

}  // namespace queen_attack

#endif // QUEEN_ATTACK_H
```

queen_attack.cpp
```
#include "queen_attack.h"
#include <cstdlib>

namespace queen_attack {

queen::queen(std::int32_t row, std::int32_t column) 
    : row_(row), column_(column) {
}

queen::queen(std::pair<std::int32_t, std::int32_t> position)
    : row_(position.first), column_(position.second) {
}

std::pair<std::int32_t, std::int32_t> queen::position() const {
    return std::make_pair(row_, column_);
}

bool queen::can_attack(const queen& other) const {
    // Check if on same row
    if (row_ == other.row_) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Check if on same column
    if (column_ == other.column_) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Check if on same diagonal
    // Two queens are on the same diagonal if the absolute difference
    // between their rows equals the absolute difference between their columns
    std::int32_t row_diff = std::abs(row_ - other.row_);
    std::int32_t col_diff = std::abs(column_ - other.column_);
    
    if (row_diff == col_diff) {
        return true;
    }
    
    return false;
}

}  // namespace queen_attack
```

The implementation:
- Uses `std::int32_t` instead of plain `int` (MISRA rule about standard integer types)
- Uses braces for all `if` statements (MISRA rule about compound statements)
- Avoids complex expressions without parentheses (MISRA rule about operator precedence)
- The `queen` class stores the position as row and column coordinates
- The `can_attack` method checks if two queens can attack each other by verifying if they share the same row, column, or diagonal
- Queens on the same diagonal have equal absolute differences between their row and column positions

Looking at the marked lines, I can see that the code is using `std::int32_t` types, which require the `<cstdint>` header. The header file already includes `<cstdint>` at line 4, so there shouldn't be any compilation errors with the type definitions.

However, I notice that the implementation file `queen_attack.cpp` uses `std::abs` function but doesn't include the necessary header. The `std::abs` function requires `<cstdlib>` (which is included) or `<cmath>` for the overloaded versions. Since we're using `std::int32_t`, we should ensure we have the correct header.

Let me update the implementation file to ensure all necessary headers are included:

queen_attack.cpp
```
#include "queen_attack.h"
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cmath>

namespace queen_attack {

queen::queen(std::int32_t row, std::int32_t column) 
    : row_(row), column_(column) {
}

queen::queen(std::pair<std::int32_t, std::int32_t> position)
    : row_(position.first), column_(position.second) {
}

std::pair<std::int32_t, std::int32_t> queen::position() const {
    return std::make_pair(row_, column_);
}

bool queen::can_attack(const queen& other) const {
    // Check if on same row
    if (row_ == other.row_) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Check if on same column
    if (column_ == other.column_) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Check if on same diagonal
    // Two queens are on the same diagonal if the absolute difference
    // between their rows equals the absolute difference between their columns
    std::int32_t row_diff = std::abs(row_ - other.row_);
    std::int32_t col_diff = std::abs(column_ - other.column_);
    
    if (row_diff == col_diff) {
        return true;
    }
    
    return false;
}

}  // namespace queen_attack
```

The header file appears to be correct and doesn't need any changes. The marked lines are using `std::int32_t` correctly with the `<cstdint>` header already included.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in queen_attack.h queen_attack.cpp to resolve the errors.  

Looking at the test errors, I can see that the tests expect a `chess_board` class that takes two queens and has methods like `white()`, `black()`, and `can_attack()`. The tests also expect the constructor to throw `std::domain_error` for invalid positions.

I need to update the code to include a `chess_board` class that manages two queens and validates their positions.

The marked lines in the header file don't show any actual errors - they're just highlighting the use of `std::int32_t` and other declarations. The code looks correct and should compile fine since `<cstdint>` is included for the `std::int32_t` type.

However, looking at the implementation file, I notice that the `chess_board` constructor is accessing private members of the `queen` class directly (`white_queen_.row_` and `white_queen_.column_`). Even though `chess_board` is declared as a friend class, it's better practice to use a public method. Also, we can simplify the check by using the already defined `operator==`.

Let me update the implementation file to fix this:

queen_attack.cpp
```
#include "queen_attack.h"
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cmath>

namespace queen_attack {

queen::queen(std::int32_t row, std::int32_t column) 
    : row_(row), column_(column) {
    // Validate position is within chess board bounds (0-7)
    if ((row < 0) || (row > 7) || (column < 0) || (column > 7)) {
        throw std::domain_error("Queen position must be on the board");
    }
}

queen::queen(std::pair<std::int32_t, std::int32_t> position)
    : row_(position.first), column_(position.second) {
    // Validate position is within chess board bounds (0-7)
    if ((row_ < 0) || (row_ > 7) || (column_ < 0) || (column_ > 7)) {
        throw std::domain_error("Queen position must be on the board");
    }
}

std::pair<std::int32_t, std::int32_t> queen::position() const {
    return std::make_pair(row_, column_);
}

bool queen::operator==(const queen& other) const {
    return ((row_ == other.row_) && (column_ == other.column_));
}

chess_board::chess_board(const queen& white_queen, const queen& black_queen)
    : white_queen_(white_queen), black_queen_(black_queen) {
    // Check if queens are on the same position
    if (white_queen == black_queen) {
        throw std::domain_error("Queens cannot occupy the same position");
    }
}

const queen& chess_board::white() const {
    return white_queen_;
}

const queen& chess_board::black() const {
    return black_queen_;
}

bool chess_board::can_attack() const {
    // Check if on same row
    if (white_queen_.row_ == black_queen_.row_) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Check if on same column
    if (white_queen_.column_ == black_queen_.column_) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Check if on same diagonal
    // Two queens are on the same diagonal if the absolute difference
    // between their rows equals the absolute difference between their columns
    std::int32_t row_diff = std::abs(white_queen_.row_ - black_queen_.row_);
    std::int32_t col_diff = std::abs(white_queen_.column_ - black_queen_.column_);
    
    if (row_diff == col_diff) {
        return true;
    }
    
    return false;
}

}  // namespace queen_attack
